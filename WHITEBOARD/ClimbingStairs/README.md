# Climbing Stairs

A child is running up a staircase that has `n` steps. The child can hop either 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Write a function `climbStairs` that counts the number of possible ways in which the child can climb the staircase. 

For example, for a staircase with n = 3 (the stair has 3 steps), there are 4 ways to climb the staircase:

1. 3 hops of 1 
2. A jump of 1 followed by a jump of 2
3. A jump of 2 followed by a jump of 1
4. A single jump of 3

So `climbStairs(3)` should return 4.
