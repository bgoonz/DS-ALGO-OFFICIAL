# Bitcoin Trading

You're trying to make your fortune by trading Bitcoin. Suppose you want to automate this task. Write a function `findMaxProfit` that receives an array of today's Bitcoin prices. Your function should return the maximum profit you can make from a single buy and sell. You must buy first before selling; shorting is not allowed. 

Examples:
```js
const bitcoinPrices = [1050, 270, 1540, 3800, 2];
findMaxProfit(bitcoinPrices);   // should return 3530, which is the max profit you can make from these prices by buying at 270 and selling at 3800
```

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
