# The general approach we'll take for this problem is to compare
# the contents of the first half of the linked list with the second
# half. If the two halves match, then we have a palindrome. There
# are many ways to go about this. Even if your interviewee doesn't
# implement a solution quite like this, if their approach is sound
# and their code works, then they are good.

# For this problem, we'll have a fast runner and a slow runner. The
# fast runner traverses the list twice as quickly as the slow runner.
# So by the time the fast runner has reached the end of the list, the
# slow runner has traversed half the list. As the slow runner moves,
# it adds the value of the node it is currently on to a stack. Now
# all we have to do is continue traversing the slow runner and
# compare the list value of the node it is currently on with the
# top element of the stack (so we're checking the elements of the
# first half of the linked list in reverse order).
