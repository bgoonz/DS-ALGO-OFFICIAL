# Smallest String

Write a function that takes two strings and returns the "smallest" string. If
both strings are equal, you may return either string. Strings will only consist 
of lowercase letters and numbers: [a - z][0 - 9]. Letters earlier in the alphabet 
are considered smaller. Consecutive digits in the string should be considered a single 
number.

```
Examples:

input: "a", "b"
expected output: "a" since "a" comes before "b" alphabetically 

input: "a1", "a2"
expected output: "a1" since 1 comes before 2

input: "a10", "a2"
expected output: "a2" since 2 comes before 10 
```

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
