# Largest Contiguous Sum

Given an array of positive and negative integers, write a function to
find the contiguous sequence (in other words, a non-empty subarray of
adjacent elements) with the largest sum. Return the sum.

Sample input: [2, 3, -8, -1, 2, 4, -2, 3] </br>
Expected output: 7, from summing up the sequence 2, 4, -2, 3

Sample input: [3, 5, -9, 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1, -5, 4] </br>
Expected output: 19, from summing up the sequence 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2,
-9, 6, 3, 1
