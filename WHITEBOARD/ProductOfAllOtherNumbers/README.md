# Product of All Other Numbers

Write a function that receives an array of integers and returns an array of the 
products.

For example, given 
```
[1, 7, 3, 4]
```
your function should return 
```
[84, 12, 28, 21]
``` 
by calculating 
```
[7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]
```

If your interviewee comes up with a solution that utilizes division, that's fine. Once they get through that, challenge them to then come up with a solution that doesn't utilize division!
Afterwards, try challenging them to come up with a solution that _doesn't_
utilize division. 

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
