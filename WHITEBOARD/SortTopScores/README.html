    <p>
      You wrote a popular game with a highest possible score of 1000. Currently,
      youâ€™re using a sorting method with a runtime of O(n log n). However, your
      sorting algorithm is slowing down the overall performance of your game,
      and players are complaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that your game has a highest possible score, can we take advantage
      of this fact to write a sorting algorithm that achieves better than O(n
      log n)?
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sorting algorithm should return an array of all the sorted scores
      with the highest scores at the beginning of the array, with the rest of
      the elements in descending order. Make your implemnetation general-purpose
      such that it can accept a <code>highestPossibleScore</code> as a
      parameter, in case we need to raise the highest possible score of our
      game.
    </p>
    <p>Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.</p>
