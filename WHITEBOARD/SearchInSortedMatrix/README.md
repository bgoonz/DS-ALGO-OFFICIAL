# Search In Sorted Matrix

Given a matrix (a two-dimensional array), whose width and height do not
necessarily match, containing distinct integers where each row is sorted and
each column is also sorted, write a function that searches for a target value in
the matrix. The function should return a tuple (or two-element array) of the row
and column indices of the target value. If the target value is not found in the
array, the function should return [-1, -1].

Sample input:
45,
```
[
    [1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 997, 999],
    [2, 5, 19, 32, 35, 1001, 1007],
    [4, 8, 24, 34, 36, 1008, 1015],
    [40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 1018, 1020],
    [98, 99, 101, 104, 190, 1021, 1025],
]
```

Expected output: [3, 4]
