# Counting Votes
You've been hired to write the software to count the votes for a local election. 
Write a function `countVotes` that receives an array of (unique) names, each one 
representing a vote for that person. Your function should return the name of the 
winner of the election. In the case of a tie, the person whose name comes last 
alphabetically wins the election (a dumb rule to be sure, but the voters don't 
need to know). 

Example:
```
input: ['veronica', 'mary', 'alex', 'james', 'mary', 'michael', 'alex', 'michael'];

expected output: 'michael'
```

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
