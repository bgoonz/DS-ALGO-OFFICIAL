# Implement a Queue with Two Stacks

Implement a Queue data structure that exhibits FIFO ordering, has an
`enqueue` method to add elements to the Queue, a `dequeue` method to
remove the next element from the Queue, and a `peek` method that returns
the next Queue element but does not remove that element from the Queue
(in other words, the `peek` method should return the same thing as the
`dequeue` method, except `peek` doesn't modify the contents of the
Queue). 

You are allowed to use up to two arrays except you are limited to array methods
that you would find on a Stack data structure, i.e. adding to the end of
the array and removing the most recently added element. You may also
index into the arrays. 

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
