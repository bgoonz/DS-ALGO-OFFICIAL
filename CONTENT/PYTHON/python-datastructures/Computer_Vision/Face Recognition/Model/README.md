# Face-Recognition-System

- Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.
- Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database.

## Aim

To develop a Face Recognition System using openCV and record the Name and Time of the person's apperance in front of the camera.

## Purpose

The purpose is to Build A Real-Time Face Recognition End-To-End Project.

## Short Description

- This project is done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV.
- OpenCV - OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.

## Workflow of the Project

- There are 4 phases in this project.

  - Face Detection and Data Gathering
  - Train the Recognizer
  - Face Recognition
  - Record Name and Time in an external CSV file.

## Execution

- OpenCV Installation On windows<br>
  <code>pip install opencv-python</code><br>
- Import the package<br>
  <code>import cv2</code><br>

All packages contain Haar cascade files. cv2.data.haarcascades can be used as a shortcut to the data folder. <br>
For example:
<code>cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")</code><br>

- Download the Source code, open in Pycharm IDE and configure the scripy file under the python interpreter
- Run the script

## Output:
