# Height of BST

## Aim

To form a Binary Search Tree of the integers entered and display its height.

## Purpose

The purpose is to work with trees.

## Short description of package/script

- The user enters the numbers to be used for constructing a BST.
- The BST is constructed according to the rules, with each node having an element entered by the user.
- A recursive function calculates the height of the tree.

## Workflow of the Project

- The tree is initialized.
- Nodes are inserted.
- Recursion is performed.
- Height is accordingly printed.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. Total number of nodes.
2. All the nodes one by one.

That's it! The height of the BST thus formed will get printed.

## Output
