      Lowest Common Ancestor Binary Tree
    </h1>
    <h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
    <p>
      The aim is to create a python code to find the Lowest Common Ancestor
      (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree, if it exists
    </p>
    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution (if any)</p>
    <h2 id="short-description-of-project">Short description of project</h2>
    <p>
      The project defines a binary tree, which is then passed to a function with
      2 nodes, which first checks if both the elements exist in the tree or not,
      based on that LCA is calculated and returned in another function by
      recursively traversing the tree which is then printed with a proper
      output.
    </p>
    <h2 id="workflow-of-the-project">Workflow of the Project</h2>
    <p>Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:</p>
    <p>
      Node –&gt; Class, to define node of the binary tree, has data, left, and
      right as attributes
    </p>
    <p>
      lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree –&gt; Function, takes in tree root, and
      both the numbers whose LCA is to be found, checks if both the elements
      exist in the tree or not, returns LCA or None based on existence
    </p>
    <p>
      exists_in_tree –&gt; Function, recursively traverses the tree, to find
      element, takes root and element as argument, returns True or False for
      existing node and non existing node respectively
    </p>
    <p>
      find_lca –&gt; Function, recursively finds and returns the LCA of the two
      numbers passed, based on the current root passed as argument
    </p>
    <p>
      print_output –&gt; Function, prints the LCA value passed based on the
      value, with a proper message
    </p>
    <p>
      After the tree root is passed to the lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree
      function, control is passed to that function, it checks existence of
      elements by calling exists_in_tree function on both the elements which
      recursively traverses the tree and returns True or False based on ans , if
      they dont exist lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree returns None, if they
      exist lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree calls find_lca function, in
      find_lca function, LCA of both the numbers is calculated and returned to
      lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree, which returns the LCA to Driver code,
      where it is saved in a variable, and passed to print_output function,
      which prints it with a proper message.

    <p>Run the script, after that :</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The tree is made manually here, to focus on finding part</li>
      <li>
        The program returns the LCA calculated of the two numbers to the driver
        code
      </li>
      <li>The program then calls a function to print the output</li>
