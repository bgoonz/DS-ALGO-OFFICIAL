# The expression tree is a binary tree in which each internal node corresponds to the operator like +,-,*,/,^ and
# each leaf node corresponds to the operand so for example expression tree for 3 + ((5+9)*2) - 3,5,9,2 will be leaf nodes
# and +,+,* will be internal and root nodes. It can be used to represent an expression.
# It can be calculated to a single value, by performing the operator in the node on its children operands.
# for example, a node (*) having two children nodes (4) and (5), can be evaluated as 4*5 = 20, so,
# the subtree with (*) as root node, can be replaced with a single node (20)


# Here we have followed a recursive approach to first evaluate the left and right child of an operator to a single value as in the above example,
# and then evaluate that operation itself, finally returning the evaluated value calculated with the eval() function of python.
