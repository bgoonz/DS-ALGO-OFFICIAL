<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<p>The aim is to create a python code to do range sum query on a segment tree of a given array of numbers</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution (if any)</p>
<h2 id="short-description-of-project">Short description of project</h2>
<p>The project takes in input the array, and then it is converted to a segment tree and returned to a new variable, then queries are called to do range sum over a range and the answer is then printed</p>
<h2 id="workflow-of-the-project">Workflow of the Project</h2>
<p>Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:</p>
<p>segment_tree_creation –&gt; Function, takes in a list, returns corresponding segment tree</p>
<p>segment_tree_range_sum_query –&gt; Function, takes in tree, lower and upper index of range whose sum is to be calculated, returns the sum</p>
<p>After the list is passed to the segment_tree_creation function, control is passed to that function, it uses the iterative approach to generate the segment tree and returns it, this segment tree is passed to the segment_tree_range_sum_query function, which calculates the sum in the given range and returns it, which is then printed</p>
<h2 id="required-libraries">Required libraries</h2>
<p>math library –&gt; for ceil and log2 functions</p>
<h2 id="compilation-steps">Compilation Steps</h2>
<p>Run the script, after that :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The expression is made manually here, to focus on conversion part</li>
<li>The program tells the equivalent segment tree</li>
<li>The program is then run to do range sum queries, and it shows the updated array and tree</li>
</ol>
