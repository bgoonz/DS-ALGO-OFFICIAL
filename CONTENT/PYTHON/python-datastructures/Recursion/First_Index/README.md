# First index of an element in an array.

## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to get first index of an element in an array.

## Purpose

The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution while implementing recursion.

## Short description of project

The program takes 3 inputs.
1.size of array.
2.Array elements.
3.Elements whose occurrence is to be found.

## Workflow of the Project

- We will divide the array into 2 parts.
  1.The first element.

2. THE remaining elements.
   \*We will work on first element and recursion will work on rest.

- First we define the base case which will be if length of array =0 return -1.
- Now we will check if our first element is equal to the element whose occurrence is to be checked.
- If yes then we will return 0.
- If no then we we call recursion on other part of array.

## Required libraries

None

## Compilation Steps

Run the script, after that :

1.  User is prompted to enter size of array followed by array elements and number whose occurrence is to be checked.
2.  First index on which the element occurred is printed.
