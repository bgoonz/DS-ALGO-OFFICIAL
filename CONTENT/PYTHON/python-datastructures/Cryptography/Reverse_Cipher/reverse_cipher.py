Aim : The user enters a string , to implement 
Reverse Cipher on the inputted string.

"""
# Reverse Cipher function to reverse the inputted string
def revers_cipher(input_string):
    # return the reversed string
    return input_string[::-1]


# getting input from the user
input_string = input("Enter the string which you would like to encrypt or decrypt : ")

# printing the output
print("The inputted String was ", input_string)
print("Reversed String is ", revers_cipher(input_string))

"""
Note : Since in reverse Cipher the working remains the same. i.e to reverse the 
       inputted string , hence we haven't segregated encryption and decryption as inputs.

"""
Sample input  : ok so it is cool
Sample output : looc si ti os ko

Explaination:
The user enters either an encrypted/decrypted string . 
After the user has provided the input the variable in which the string 
is stored is passed onto a Revers_cipher function.
The Revers_cipher function reverses the string and returns the reversed string.
