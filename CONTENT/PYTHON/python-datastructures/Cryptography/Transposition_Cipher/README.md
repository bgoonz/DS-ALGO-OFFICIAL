# Transposition Cipher

## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to decrypt or encrpt text using transposition cipher

## Short description of project

The code takes in input string that needs to be encrypted and uses transpositional cipher to encrypt it similarly the reverse is applied for decryption.

Workflow of the Project
Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

encryption --> encrypt the plain text to cipher text using transposition cipher.

decryption --> decrypt the cipher text to plain text using transposition cipher.

After the desired values are entered by the user, the control is passed to the encryption function, which returns the encrypted text and then this text is passed to decryption and output is displayed as both encrypted and decrypted text.

## Setup instructions

Download the code and open it in your prefered code editor, then run it.

## Required libraries

math

## Compilation Steps

Run the script, after that :

1.  User is prompted to enter key (integer)
2.  User is again prompted to enter the string/message to be encrypted or decrypted
3.  The program tells encrypts or decrypts the string

## Sample Test Cases

Combination of different keys and your text that you want to encrypt/decrypt.
Eg) Key=5 and mssg= 'Your roommate is a spy'
