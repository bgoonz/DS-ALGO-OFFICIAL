# Infix to Postfix Conversion

## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to convert an infix expression to its equivalent postfix expression

## Purpose

The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution while implementing stacks (if any)

## Short description of project

The project takes in input the infix expression to be converted,
and then it parses through the expression, checking the type of character and performing the required operation according to the algorithm.
The resultant postfix expression is then returned and printed.

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

isEmpty --> Function, takes in a list, returns True if it is empty, and False if not

infix_to_postfix --> Converts infix expression to postfix using stack, takes argument : infix expression string, returns : equivalent postfix expressiion string

After the infix expression is passed to the infix_to_postfix function, control is passed to that function, it uses the stack algorithm to generate the equivalent postfix expression and returns it,
which is then printed with a proper output by the driver code.

## Required libraries

None

## Compilation Steps

Run the script, after that :

1.  The expression is made manually here, to focus on conversion part
2.  The program tells the equivalent postfix expression
