# Divisor Sum

## Aim

Calculate the sum of all the divisors of the entered number and display it.

## Purpose

The purpose is to work with arrays.

## Short description of package/script

- We can find the factors of a number by trying to divide it from all the numbers from 1 to the number itself+1.
- All these divisors leave no remainders.
- Such numbers are appended into list.
- The sum of this list is what that is required.

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

divisorSum --> Function to find out all divisors and add them up.

The input is sent to the function which computes the result.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. A number.

That's it! The sum of all its divisors would be printed out.
