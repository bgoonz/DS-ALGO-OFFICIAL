      Shell sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on
      insertion sort algorithm. Shell sort is the generalization of insertion
      sort which overcomes the drawbacks of insertion sort by comparing elements
      separated by a gap of several positions.

      Shell sort divides the array in the form of N/2 , N/4 , …, 1 (where N is
      the length of array) and then sorting is done. This breaking of sequence
      and sorting takes place until the entire array is sorted.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s take an example to understand.</p>
    <p>
      12 15 50 10 35 19 11 44 <strong>Stage 1: Divide</strong> In this stage the
      unsorted array is divided in the form of N/2. Here N/2 is 8/2 = 4, which
      means the 0th and 4th elements, 1st and 5th and so on are compared and
      swapped if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Now after first stage the array is in this form:</p>
    <p>
      12 15 11 10 35 19 50 44 <strong>Stage 2: Again Divide</strong> In this
      stage the unsorted array is again divided in the form of N/4. Here N/4 is
      8/4 = 2, which means the 0th and 2th elements, 1st and 3th and so on are
      compared and swapped if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Now after second stage the array is in this form:</p>
    <p>
      11 10 12 15 35 19 50 44
      <strong>Stage 3: Again Divide when the interval 1</strong> In this stage
      the unsorted array is again divided in the form of N/8. Here N/8 is 8/8 =
      1, which means the 0th and 1th elements, 1st and 2th and so on are
      compared and swapped if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Now after final stage the array is in this form:</p>
    <p>
      10 11 12 15 19 35 44 50 After the final process the unsorted array is
      sorted.
