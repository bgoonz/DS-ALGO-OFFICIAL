## Script Name

Merge Sort Algorithm.

## Aim

To write a program for Merge sort.

## Purpose

To get a understanding about Merge sort.

## Short description of package/script

- It is a python program of Merge sort Algorithm.
- It is written in a way that it takes user input.

## Workflow of the Project

- First a function is written to perform diving array in two halves.
- Then another funtion perform merging of array.

## Detailed explanation of script, if needed

Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves,
calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

### Algorithm

- Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
   middle m = l+ (r-l)/2
- Call mergeSort for first half:  
   Call merge_sort(arr, l, m)
- Call mergeSort for second half:
  Call merge_sort(arr, m+1, r)
- Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
  Call merge_array(arr, l, m, r)
- call the array again using recursion.
