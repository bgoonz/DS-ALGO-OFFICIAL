## Script Name

Selection Sort Algorithm.

## Aim

To write a program for Selection sort.

## Purpose

To get a understanding about selection sort.

## Short description of package/script

- It is a python program of selectiom sort Algorithm.
- It is written in a way that it takes user input.

## Workflow of the Project

- First a function is written to perform Bubble sort.
- Then outside the function user input is taken.

## Detailed explanation of script, if needed

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm. Sorting algorithm are
used to arrange the array in particular order.It finds the smallest
element and brings it to the beginning.Two subarrys are maintained.

- The sorted subarray.
- The unsorted subarray.
  In every iteration minimum element from the unsorted array is is
  picked and moved to the sorted array.

### Algorithm

- Set first element as minimum.
- Compare the minimum element with second element and if
  the second element is smaller then assign it to minimum.
- Then,go on comparing minimum to the end of array.
- Swap the first element and minimum.
- For next iteration start from the second element as first
  element is already sorted.
- Repeat these steps till array is sorted.

### Example

```

arr[] =  25 6 10 22 99
1st iteration:
Minimum element is 6 and starting element is 25 so we swap
25 and 6.
The array becomes
arr[]= 6 25 10 22 99

Iteration 2:
Here we start from second element.
Minimum element is 10 and starting element is 25 so we swap
10 and 25.
arr[]= 6 10 25 22 99

Iteration 3:
Here we start from 3rd element.
Minimum element is 22 and starting element is 25 so we swap
25 and 22.
arr[]=6 10 22 25 99

Hence,our array is sorted.
