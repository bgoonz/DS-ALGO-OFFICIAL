    <p>
      Computer vision is a field of computer science that works on enabling
      computers to see, identify and process images in the same way that human
      vision does, and then provide appropriate output. It is like imparting
      human intelligence and instincts to a computer. Image processing and
      computer vision are a little different from each other. Image processing
      means applying some algorithms for transforming image from one form to the
      other like smoothing, contrasting, stretching, etc. While computer vision
      comes from modelling image processing using the techniques of machine
      learning, computer vision applies machine learning to recognize patterns
      for interpretation of images (much like the process of visual reasoning of
      human vision).
