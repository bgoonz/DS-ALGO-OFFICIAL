      The problem can be represented by a graph, with the nodes representing the
      words, and edges between words that differ by only 1 character, then we
      only need to find the shortest distance from a start node to an end node.
      Obviously, this is a problem solvable by BFS.

      But a naive BFS solution will exceed time limit. Because calculating the
      difference between every pair of words is O(N^2) time, to reduce the time,
      observe that for a word with length N, trying to replace every char with a
      different char in alphabet only requires N*26.
