      We can to record the sums, put sum from start up to index i into
      sums[i+1]. Then a O(N^2) solution is to loop over each pair of indices (i,
      j), if lower&lt;=sums[j]-sums[i]&lt;=upper, then we find a range with sum
      that satisfies the condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do better, we have to divide and conquer. Observe that if we divide a
      range (I,J) into (I, mid) and (mid, J), then the pair of indices that
      satisfies the constraint have to be:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>both between I and mid</li>
      <li>both between mid and J</li>
      <li>i is between I and mid, j is between mid and J</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      if we already solved the sub-problems of 1) and 2), we only need to count
      the pairs for 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      If i is in (I, mid) and j is in (mid, J), then the order of 2 subsequences
      doesn’t matter. We can sort both subsequences, and for each item i in
      range 1), use 2 cursors in range 2) to find the number of items j, with
      sums[j]-sum[i] between (lower, upper). Since the subsequence is ordered,
      the cursors can be reused in the inner loop for the next i.
    </p>
    <p>The time complexity for this solution is O(N*log(N)).</p>
