// You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

// Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

// For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
