## [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

### Problem:

Given _n_ non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![rainwatertrap.png](http://www.leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/rainwatertrap.png)
The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!

**Example:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

### Solution:

Well explained by Leetcode official: <https://leetcode.com/articles/trapping-rain-water/> .

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
let trap = function (height) {
  let i = 0;
  let j = height.length - 1;
  let lMax = 0;
  let rMax = 0;
  let result = 0;

  while (i < j) {
    const left = height[i];
    const right = height[j];
    if (left < right) {
      if (left < lMax) {
        result += lMax - left;
      } else {
        lMax = left;
      }
      i++;
    } else {
      if (right < rMax) {
        result += rMax - right;
      } else {
        rMax = right;
      }
      j--;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
