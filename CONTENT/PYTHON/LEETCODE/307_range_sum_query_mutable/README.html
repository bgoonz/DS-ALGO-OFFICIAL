      First, the most obvious solution is to just keep the numbers, and compute
      the range sum by iterating over the elements in the range. The update is
      O(1), rangeSum is O(N).
    </p>
    <p>
      The next idea is to maintain a list of partial sums array, sums[i] is the
      sum of all elements up to index i. Now, when updating a element i, every
      sum element after i needs to be updated with the diff, a O(N) operation.
      rangeSum is sum[j]-sum[i], a O(1) operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all depends on how these 2 operations are distributed. If both
      operations are very frequent, then a Log(N) algorithm is required.

      This is where BIT (binary index tree) comes in. The best material I find
      about BIT is here:
