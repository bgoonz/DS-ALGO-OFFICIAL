Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together
other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a
list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists
might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have
the same type.

    # Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain
    # as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.

    # Like strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be

    assert squares[-1] == 25
    assert squares[-3:] == [9, 16, 25]  # slicing returns a new list

    # All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements.
    # This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of
    # the list:
    assert squares[:] == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

    # Lists also support operations like concatenation:

    # is possible to change their content:

    cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
    assert cubes == [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

    # You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using
    # the append() method
    cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
    cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
    assert cubes == [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]

    # Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size
    # of the list or clear it entirely:
    letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']

    # The built-in function len() also applies to lists

    A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause,
