// Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

// OJ's undirected graph serialization:
// Nodes are labeled uniquely.

// We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
// As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

// The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

// First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
// Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
// Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
// Visually, the graph looks like the following:

//        1
//       / \
//      /   \
//     0 --- 2
//          / \
//          \_/
