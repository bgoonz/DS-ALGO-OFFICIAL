<p>At first, this solution looks like this:</p>
<p>Find the largest digit starting from the beginning of num1 and num2, and append to the result, subject to one restriction - the number of digits left in num1 and num2 (after taking the digit) have to be greater than or equal to k-1.</p>
<p>My first solution: for the largest digit found, try every valid position of this digit in both num1 and num2, and recurse. TLE. Then I start to look for optimizations.</p>
<p>My second solution: for the largest digit, I only look at the first valid position in each num, that should be enough, and I eliminate the need of an inner loop by using a radix bucket for [0-9].</p>
<p>But the result is still TLE. The time complexity is still exponential in the worst case; O(2^k) - each time I pick the next digit, there are 2 possible choices.</p>
<p>Then it occurs to me that I can deal with num1 and num2 independantly: If I find the largest subsequence of length l1 for num1, and largest subsequence of length l2 for num2, I can get the largest sequence of length l1+l2 by merging the two. The result of this problem can be broken into LS of num1 and LS of num2, this can be proved by contradiction.</p>
<p>So in the end, the solution is:</p>
<pre><code>For i in range(0, len(num1)):
    find largest subsequence of length i from num1
    find largest subsequence of length (k-i) from num2
    merge the 2 by picking the larger value from the left side of 2 subsequences</code></pre>
<p>There is one more detail, during the merge, if s[0]==s[1], then what? The intuition is “it doesn’t matter, to pick either one is ok”, but actually, it matters:</p>
<pre><code>355555
366666</code></pre>
<p>If I pick the first 3, the result is 355555366666, else, the result is 366666355555.</p>
<p>You have to compare the whole sequence to decide which num to pick.</p>
