## [60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/)

### Problem:

The set `[1,2,3,...,*n*]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for _n_ = 3:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given _n_ and _k_, return the *k*th permutation sequence.

**Note:**

- Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Given *k* will be between 1 and _n_! inclusive.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

### Solution:

The order of the sequence is fixed hence can be calculated. We can view the process as picking digits from a sorted set `[1...n]`.

Each digit appears `(n-1)!` times in `result[0]`. And for a fixed `result[0]` each digit appears `(n-2)!` times in `result[1]`. So on.

We also need `k--` to convert `k` into index so that `k <= (n-1)!` maps `0` (and get `1` from the set).

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {string}
 */
let getPermutation = function (n, k) {
  const digits = [];
  let factorial = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    digits.push(i);
    factorial *= i;
  }

  k--;

  let result = "";
  while (n > 0) {
    factorial /= n;
    result += digits.splice((k / factorial) | 0, 1)[0];
    k %= factorial;
    n--;
  }

  return result;
};
```
