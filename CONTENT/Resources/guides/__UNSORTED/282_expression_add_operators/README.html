<p>This is obviously a DP problem.</p>
<p>But it is hard to partition it into sub-problems because of operator precedence: 1+2*3+4</p>
<p>If we partition the problem into <code>12</code> and <code>34</code>, then the values calculated from subproblems cannot be used to construct solution for the big problem. So we need 2 levels of recursion:</p>
<p>First level is for <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, second level is for <code>*</code> operator.</p>
<p>For each finished expression like <code>1*2+3-4</code>, we find the leftmost + or - operator, character to its left is either an atomic number or a <code>*</code> expression, then we can recurse with <code>*</code> on the left, and recurse with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> on the right.</p>
<p>There is a minor problem with “-” operator: 1-2+3 is not equal to 1-(2+3)</p>
<p>We can treat minus as adding a negative number. For every atomic number or <code>*</code> expression, we consider adding either the number or its negative number, and adjust the expression accordingly.</p>
<p>In the end, we need to filter out expressions that starts with a “-” sign. (Because operators are only allowed <em>between</em> numbers).</p>
