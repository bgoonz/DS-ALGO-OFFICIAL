    <p>This is obviously a DP problem.</p>
    <p>
      But it is hard to partition it into sub-problems because of operator
      precedence: 1+2*3+4
    </p>
    <p>
      If we partition the problem into <code>12</code> and <code>34</code>, then
      the values calculated from subproblems cannot be used to construct
      solution for the big problem. So we need 2 levels of recursion:
    </p>
    <p>
      First level is for <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, second level is for
      <code>*</code> operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each finished expression like <code>1*2+3-4</code>, we find the
      leftmost + or - operator, character to its left is either an atomic number
      or a <code>*</code> expression, then we can recurse with <code>*</code> on
      the left, and recurse with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a minor problem with “-” operator: 1-2+3 is not equal to 1-(2+3)
    </p>
    <p>
      We can treat minus as adding a negative number. For every atomic number or
      <code>*</code> expression, we consider adding either the number or its
      negative number, and adjust the expression accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, we need to filter out expressions that starts with a “-” sign.
      (Because operators are only allowed <em>between</em> numbers).
