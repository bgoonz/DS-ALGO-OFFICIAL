    <h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
    <p>
      Say you have an array for which the <em>i</em>th element is the price of a
      given stock on day <em>i</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
      transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock
      multiple times).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the
      same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.</code></pre>
    <h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>
    <p>
      Sell immediately after the price drops. Or in other perspective, it is the
      sum of all the incremental pairs (buy in then immediately sell out).
    </p>
    <pre><code>/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let max = 0
  for (let i = 1; i &lt; prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] &gt; prices[i-1]) {
      max += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
    }
  }
  return max
};</code></pre>
