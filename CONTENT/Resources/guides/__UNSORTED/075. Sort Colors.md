## [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

### Problem:

Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place**so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library’s sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

    Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
    Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s, then overwrite array with total number of 0’s, then 1’s and followed by 2’s.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

### Solution:

One-pass algorithm.

Take the idea of the partition algorithm from quick sort. Use `1` as pivot.

Count the number of sorted `0`s and `2`s so that we know where to swap.

    /**
     * @param {number[]} nums
     * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
     */
    var sortColors = function(nums) {
      const len = nums.length
      let zeroEnd = 0
      let twoStart = len - 1
      let i = 0
      while (i <= twoStart) {
        if (nums[i] === 0 && i !== zeroEnd) {
          const t = nums[i]
          nums[i] = nums[zeroEnd]
          nums[zeroEnd] = t
          zeroEnd++
        } else if (nums[i] === 2 && i !== twoStart) {
          const t = nums[i]
          nums[i] = nums[twoStart]
          nums[twoStart] = t
          twoStart--
        } else {
          i++
        }
      }
    };
