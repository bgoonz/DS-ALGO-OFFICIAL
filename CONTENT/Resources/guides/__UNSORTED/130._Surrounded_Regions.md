## [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/)

### Problem:

Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X

After running your function, the board should be:

    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

### Solution:

Find all the `O`s that are connected to the `O`s on the border, change them to `#`. Then scan the board, change `O` to `X` and `#` back to `O`.

The process of finding the connected `O`s is just like tree traversal. `O`s on the border are the same level. Their children are the second level. And so on.

So both BFS and DFS are good. I prefer BFS when pruning is not needed in favor of its readability.
