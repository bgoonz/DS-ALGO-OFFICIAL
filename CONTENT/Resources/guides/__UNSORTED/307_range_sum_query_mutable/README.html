<p>First, the most obvious solution is to just keep the numbers, and compute the range sum by iterating over the elements in the range. The update is O(1), rangeSum is O(N).</p>
<p>The next idea is to maintain a list of partial sums array, sums[i] is the sum of all elements up to index i. Now, when updating a element i, every sum element after i needs to be updated with the diff, a O(N) operation. rangeSum is sum[j]-sum[i], a O(1) operation.</p>
<p>It all depends on how these 2 operations are distributed. If both operations are very frequent, then a Log(N) algorithm is required.</p>
<p>This is where BIT (binary index tree) comes in. The best material I find about BIT is here: <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10538/bit-what-is-the-intuition-behind-a-binary-indexed-tree-and-how-was-it-thought-a">http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10538/bit-what-is-the-intuition-behind-a-binary-indexed-tree-and-how-was-it-thought-a</a></p>
