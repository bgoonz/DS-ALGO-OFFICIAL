# Binary Search (A divide and conquer algorithm)

#### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of n elements, write a function to search for the index of a given element (target)

#### Approach

- Search for the array by dividing the array in half repeatedly.
- Initially consider the actual array and pick the element at the middle index
- Keep a lower index i.e. 0 and higher index i.e. length of array
- If it is equal to the target element then return the index
- Else if it is greater than the target element then consider only the left half of array. (lower index = 0, higher = middle - 1)
- Else if it is less than the target element then consider only the right half of array. (lower index = middle + 1, higher = length of array)
- Return -1 if target element is not found in the array (Base Case: If lower index is greater than or equal to higher index)

#### Time Complexity

O(log n) Worse Case  
O(1) Best Case (If middle element of initial array is the target element)

#### Space Complexity

O(1) For iterative approach  
O(log n) For recursive approach due to recursion call stack

#### Example

```
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

target = 2
Initially the element at middle index is 4 which is greater than 2. Therefore we search the left half of the
array i.e. [1,2,3].
Here we find the middle element equal to target element so we return its index i.e. 1

target = 9
Binary Search should return -1 as 9 is not present in the array
```
