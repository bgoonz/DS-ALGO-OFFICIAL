<p>It is easy to come up with the recursive backtracking solution (for each * in the pattern, the wildcard can match many char sequences). But the time complexity is exponential.</p>
<p>Here is my observation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If p starts with something other than *, s has to start with a matching substr.</li>
<li>If p ends with something other than *, s has to end with a matching substr.</li>
<li>If p starts and ends with <em>, I can split p by </em> into subpatterns, these subpatterns have to match sequentially in s.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the algorithm is to consume the head and tail of p first, until p starts and ends with * (or p is empty). Then split p into subpatterns, find each subpattern sequentially in s, if all of them can be found, return True, else, return False.</p>
