    <h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
    <p>
      Say you have an array for which the <em>i</em>th element is the price of a
      given stock on day <em>i</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most
      <em>two</em> transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong>You may not engage in multiple transactions at the
      same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.</code></pre>
    <h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple transactions may not be engaged in at the same time. That means
      if we view the days that involed in the same transaction as a group, there
      won’t be any intersection. We may complete at most
      <em>two</em> transactions, so divide the days into two groups,
      <code>[0...k]</code> and <code>[k...n-1]</code>. Notice
      <code>k</code> exists in both groups because technically we can sell out
      then immediately buy in at the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <code>p1(i)</code> to be the max profit of day
      <code>[0...i]</code>. This is just like the problem of
      <a href="./121.%20Best%20Time%20to%20Buy%20and%20Sell%20Stock.md"
        >121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</a
      >.
    </p>
    <pre><code>p1(0) = 0
p1(i) = max( p1(i-1), prices[i] - min(prices[0], ..., prices[i-1]) ), 0 &lt; i &lt;= n-1</code></pre>
    <p>
      Define <code>p2(i)</code> to be the max profit of day
      <code>[i...n-1]</code>. This is the mirror of <code>p1</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>p2(n-1) = 0
p2(i) = max( p2(i+1), max(prices[i], ..., prices[n-1]) - prices[i] ), n-1 &gt; i &gt;= 0</code></pre>
    <p>
      Define <code>f(k)</code> to be <code>p1(k) + p2(k)</code>. We need to get
      <code>max( f(0), ..., f(n-1) )</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  const len = prices.length
  if (len &lt;= 1) { return 0 }

  const dp = [0]

  let min = prices[0]
  for (let i = 1; i &lt; len; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], prices[i] - min)
    min = Math.min(prices[i], min)
  }

  let p2 = 0
  let max = prices[len-1]
  for (let i = len-2; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
    max = Math.max(prices[i], max)
    p2 = Math.max(p2, max - prices[i])
    dp[i] += p2
  }

  return Math.max(...dp)
};</code></pre>
