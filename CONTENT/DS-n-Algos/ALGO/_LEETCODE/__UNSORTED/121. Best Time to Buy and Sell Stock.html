<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>Say you have an array for which the <em>i</em>th element is the price of a given stock on day <em>i</em>.</p>
<p>If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Â             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.</code></pre>
<h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>
<p>Only care about positive profits. Take the frist item as base and scan to the right. If we encounter an item <code>j</code> whose price <code>price[j]</code> is lower than the base (which means if we sell now the profit would be negative), we sell <code>j-1</code> instead and make <code>j</code> the new base.</p>
<p>Because <code>price[j]</code> is lower that the base, using <code>j</code> as new base is guaranteed to gain more profit comparing to the old one.</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let max = 0
  let base = prices[0]
  for (let i = 1; i &lt; prices.length; i++) {
    const profit = prices[i] - base
    if (profit &gt; max) {
      max = profit
    } else if (profit &lt; 0) {
      base = prices[i]
    }
  }
  return max
};</code></pre>
