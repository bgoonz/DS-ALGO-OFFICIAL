    <p>This is a brain teaser kind of problem.</p>
    <p>
      Observation #1, whether #N light stays on depends on how many unique
      factors N have. Prime numbers must be off, because it is switched on Round
      1 and off in Round N.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observation #2, for a light #N to stays on, N needs to have odd number of
      factors. Fact: only square numbers can have odd number of unique factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proof by contradiction: If a number has odd number of unique factors, and
      is not a square number, write down all its unique factors, and start
      crossing off the factors: If I<em
        >J=N, cross off J as well as I. In the end, there is only one factor M
        left, M</em
      >M has to be N.
    </p>
