// There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors.
// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
// You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix.
// For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0;
// costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

// Note:
// All costs are positive integers.

// Follow up:
// Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
