/**
 * Solution: Two pointers. Slow moves one step a time, fast moves two steps a time.
 * Once fast meets slow, the steps fast moved is twice as the steps slow moved.
 * After they met, in order to move to the cycle start place, the steps fast needs to move
 * equals to the steps the head need to mve. Here is the reason:
 * n1 -> n2 -> n3 -> n4 -> n2 the cycle starts at n2, slow and fast meet at n4
 * assume n1 -> n4 needs a steps, n2 -> n4 needs b steps, n4-> n2 needs c steps.
 * when fast reach n4, it takes (a + b + c + b) steps, slow reached n4, it takes a + b,
 * a + b + c + b = 2 * (a + b), so a = c. => head && fast move at the same, when they meet, that's
 * the place where the cycle starts
 *
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
