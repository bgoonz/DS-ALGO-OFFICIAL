## [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/)

### Problem:

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### Solution:

Sell immediately after the price drops. Or in other perspective, it is the sum of all the incremental pairs (buy in then immediately sell out).

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
let maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let max = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
      max += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
    }
  }
  return max;
};
```
