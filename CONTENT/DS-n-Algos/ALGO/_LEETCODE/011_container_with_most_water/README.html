<p>It looks like the solution requires O(N*N) complexity, by selecting every pair of indices and computing the amount of water hold by the corresponding container.</p>
<p>But, similiar to the 2-sum problem, this can be solved with 2 pointers moving towards each other. The rule to update the pointers are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Advance the pointer with the smaller height. In other words, if height[lo]&lt;=height[hi], lo++; else, hi++. The rationale is: if we advance the pointer with larger height, we reduce the distance, but donâ€™t increase the height used for product (water = distance * height).</li>
<li>When advancing the pointer, we skip the indices with smaller height than current index. The rationale: that reduce both height and distance, producing a smaller product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, by using the 2 pointer algorithm, we skip some pairs of indices, we need to prove that those pairs can never produce the maximum product. A proof of contradiction is quite obvious.</p>
