      It looks like the solution requires O(N*N) complexity, by selecting every
      pair of indices and computing the amount of water hold by the
      corresponding container.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, similiar to the 2-sum problem, this can be solved with 2 pointers
      moving towards each other. The rule to update the pointers are:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Advance the pointer with the smaller height. In other words, if
        height[lo]&lt;=height[hi], lo++; else, hi++. The rationale is: if we
        advance the pointer with larger height, we reduce the distance, but
        don’t increase the height used for product (water = distance * height).
      </li>
      <li>
        When advancing the pointer, we skip the indices with smaller height than
        current index. The rationale: that reduce both height and distance,
        producing a smaller product.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Of course, by using the 2 pointer algorithm, we skip some pairs of
      indices, we need to prove that those pairs can never produce the maximum
      product. A proof of contradiction is quite obvious.
