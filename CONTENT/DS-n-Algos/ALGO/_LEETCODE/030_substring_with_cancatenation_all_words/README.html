    <p>This problem can be solved in O(NK).</p>
    <p>
      Assuming the length of each word is K, then no matter how long the string
      is, a match can be found by starting at position (0 to K-1) and advance by
      units of K.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each of the K starting positions, we can find all matches in a single
      pass by maintaining 2 cursors, one pointing at the start of current
      cancatenation, and the other at the end. And we take the next K chars and
      compare it to words:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        If it is not in words, matching fails. We advance both start and end to
        current position + K.
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is in words, and count of this word is less than or equal to the
        required word count, we update the counter, and advance the end cursor.
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is in words, but count of this word exceeds the limit, we trim the
        start word - advance the start cursor, and update the counter by
        decrementing the count for start word.
      </li>
    </ol>
