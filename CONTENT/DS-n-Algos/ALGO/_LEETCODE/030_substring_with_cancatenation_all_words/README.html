<p>This problem can be solved in O(NK).</p>
<p>Assuming the length of each word is K, then no matter how long the string is, a match can be found by starting at position (0 to K-1) and advance by units of K.</p>
<p>For each of the K starting positions, we can find all matches in a single pass by maintaining 2 cursors, one pointing at the start of current cancatenation, and the other at the end. And we take the next K chars and compare it to words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If it is not in words, matching fails. We advance both start and end to current position + K.</li>
<li>If it is in words, and count of this word is less than or equal to the required word count, we update the counter, and advance the end cursor.</li>
<li>If it is in words, but count of this word exceeds the limit, we trim the start word - advance the start cursor, and update the counter by decrementing the count for start word.</li>
</ol>
