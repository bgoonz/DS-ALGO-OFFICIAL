      Water can only be hold between peaks. If you look at the pattern of pair
      of peaks that hold water, you can see that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        From left to the highest peaks, the peaks that form alleys are in
        ascending order, and the peak at i is the largest for 0-i.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the highest peak to the right, the peaks are in descending order,
        and the peak at j is the largest from j to the end.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So the problem is reduced to 2 passes over the heights array:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Start from the left, for each pos i, if a[i] &gt; maxheight up to i, put
        i in lefts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start from the right, for each pos j, if a[j] &gt; maxheight from j to
        end, put j in rights.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Now we can get the pair of peaks that form valleys (mind duplicate pairs
      with same heights). Calculate the amount of water between 2 peaks is
      straightforward.
