<p>Water can only be hold between peaks. If you look at the pattern of pair of peaks that hold water, you can see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>From left to the highest peaks, the peaks that form alleys are in ascending order, and the peak at i is the largest for 0-i.</li>
<li>From the highest peak to the right, the peaks are in descending order, and the peak at j is the largest from j to the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the problem is reduced to 2 passes over the heights array:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start from the left, for each pos i, if a[i] &gt; maxheight up to i, put i in lefts.</li>
<li>Start from the right, for each pos j, if a[j] &gt; maxheight from j to end, put j in rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can get the pair of peaks that form valleys (mind duplicate pairs with same heights). Calculate the amount of water between 2 peaks is straightforward.</p>
