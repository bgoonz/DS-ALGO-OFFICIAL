    <h1 id="time-planner">Time Planner</h1>
    <p>
      Implement a time planner that receives the availability of two people and
      a duration. The time planner should return the earliest time slot that
      matches the given duration where both people have availability. If there
      is no common time slot that satisfies these requirements, return an empty
      array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each person’s availability will be an array of two-element arrays. Each
      two-element array’s first element represents the start time of a time
      slot, and the second array element represents the end time of that time
      slot. The input variable <code>duration</code> is a positive integer that
      represents the duration of a meeting in seconds. The output should be an
      array with the appropriate start time and end time that meets all of the
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre><code>input: a = [[10, 50], [60, 120], [140, 210]]
       b = [[0, 15], [60, 70]]
       duration = 8
output: [60, 68]

input: a = [[10, 50], [60, 120], [140, 210]]
       b = [[0, 15], [60, 72]]
       duration = 12
output: [60, 72]

input: a = [[10, 50], [60, 120], [140, 210]]
       b = [[0, 15], [60, 70]]
       duration = 12
output: [] // since there is no common slot</code></pre>
    <p>
      These example inputs are obviously not realistic input numbers for
      representing meeting times. Ideally the inputs would consist of Unix epoch
      timestamps, but those are very large numbers to have to type out over and
      over again, so we’re just going to fake that part. If your function works
      with these faux inputs, it will work just fine with Unix timestamps.
