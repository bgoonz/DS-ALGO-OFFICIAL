<h1 id="word-analytics">Word Analytics</h1>
<p>You’re a newly hired engineer for a brand-new company that’s building a “killer Word-like application”. You’ve been specifically assigned to implement a tool that gives the user some details on common word usage, letter usage, and some other analytics for a given document! More specifically, you must read a given text file (no special formatting, just a plain ASCII text file) and print off the following details:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Number of words</li>
<li>Number of letters</li>
<li>Number of symbols (any non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white spaces)</li>
<li>Top three most common words (you may count “small words”, such as “it” or “the”)</li>
<li>Top three most common letters</li>
<li>Most common first word of a paragraph (paragraph being defined as a block of text with an empty line above it) (Optional bonus)</li>
<li>Number of words only used once (Optional bonus)</li>
<li>All letters not used in the document (Optional bonus)</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that your tool does not have to be case sensitive, meaning the word “Hello” is the same as “hello” and “HELLO”.</p>

<h3 id="input-description">Input Description</h3>
<p>As an argument to your program on the command line, you will be given a text file location (such as “C:22.txt” on Windows or “/Users/nint22/Document.txt” on any other sane file system). This file may be empty, but will be guaranteed well-formed (all valid ASCII characters). You can assume that line endings will follow the UNIX-style new-line ending (unlike the Windows carriage-return &amp; new-line format ).</p>
<h3 id="output-description">Output Description</h3>
<p>For each analytic feature, you must print the results in a special string format. Simply you will print off 6 to 8 sentences with the following format:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;A words&quot;, where A is the number of words in the given document
&quot;B letters&quot;, where B is the number of letters in the given document
&quot;C symbols&quot;, where C is the number of non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white spaces, in the document
&quot;Top three most common words: D, E, F&quot;, where D, E, and F are the top three most common words
&quot;Top three most common letters: G, H, I&quot;, where G, H, and I are the top three most common letters
&quot;J is the most common first word of all paragraphs&quot;, where J is the most common word at the start of all paragraphs in the document (paragraph being defined as a block of text with an empty line above it) (*Optional bonus*)
&quot;Words only used once: K&quot;, where K is a comma-delimited list of all words only used once (*Optional bonus*)
&quot;Letters not used in the document: L&quot;, where L is a comma-delimited list of all alphabetic characters not in the document (*Optional bonus*)</code></pre>
<p>If there are certain lines that have no answers (such as the situation in which a given document has no paragraph structures), simply do not print that line of text. In this example, I’ve just generated some random Lorem Ipsum text.</p>
