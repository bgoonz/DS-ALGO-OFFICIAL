    <h1 id="word-analytics">Word Analytics</h1>
    <p>
      You’re a newly hired engineer for a brand-new company that’s building a
      “killer Word-like application”. You’ve been specifically assigned to
      implement a tool that gives the user some details on common word usage,
      letter usage, and some other analytics for a given document! More
      specifically, you must read a given text file (no special formatting, just
      a plain ASCII text file) and print off the following details:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Number of words</li>
      <li>Number of letters</li>
      <li>
        Number of symbols (any non-letter and non-digit character, excluding
        white spaces)
      </li>
      <li>
        Top three most common words (you may count “small words”, such as “it”
        or “the”)
      </li>
      <li>Top three most common letters</li>
      <li>
        Most common first word of a paragraph (paragraph being defined as a
        block of text with an empty line above it) (Optional bonus)
      </li>
      <li>Number of words only used once (Optional bonus)</li>
      <li>All letters not used in the document (Optional bonus)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Please note that your tool does not have to be case sensitive, meaning the
      word “Hello” is the same as “hello” and “HELLO”.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an argument to your program on the command line, you will be given a
      text file location (such as “C:22.txt” on Windows or
      “/Users/nint22/Document.txt” on any other sane file system). This file may
      be empty, but will be guaranteed well-formed (all valid ASCII characters).
      You can assume that line endings will follow the UNIX-style new-line
      ending (unlike the Windows carriage-return &amp; new-line format ).
    </p>
    <h3 id="output-description">Output Description</h3>
    <p>
      For each analytic feature, you must print the results in a special string
      format. Simply you will print off 6 to 8 sentences with the following
      format:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&quot;A words&quot;, where A is the number of words in the given document
&quot;B letters&quot;, where B is the number of letters in the given document
&quot;C symbols&quot;, where C is the number of non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white spaces, in the document
&quot;Top three most common words: D, E, F&quot;, where D, E, and F are the top three most common words
&quot;Top three most common letters: G, H, I&quot;, where G, H, and I are the top three most common letters
&quot;J is the most common first word of all paragraphs&quot;, where J is the most common word at the start of all paragraphs in the document (paragraph being defined as a block of text with an empty line above it) (*Optional bonus*)
&quot;Words only used once: K&quot;, where K is a comma-delimited list of all words only used once (*Optional bonus*)
&quot;Letters not used in the document: L&quot;, where L is a comma-delimited list of all alphabetic characters not in the document (*Optional bonus*)</code></pre>
    <p>
      If there are certain lines that have no answers (such as the situation in
      which a given document has no paragraph structures), simply do not print
      that line of text. In this example, I’ve just generated some random Lorem
      Ipsum text.
