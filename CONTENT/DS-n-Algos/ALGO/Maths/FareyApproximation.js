 *
 * Farey Approximation algorithm is an algorithm to
 * approximate a reduced fraction value for a certain
 * decimal number x where 0 < x < 1.
 *
 * The algorithm works by keeping two fractional upper and
 * lower bounds which start at 0 / 1 and 1 / 1. These values
 * are then used to find the "mediate" which is a value between
 * the two fractions.
 *
 * For any two fractions a / b and c / d,
 * mediate = a + c / b + d
 *
 * Then it is checked if the decimal is greater than or less
 * than the mediate and then the lower or the upper value is
 * set to be the mediate respectively.
 *
 * This is repeated for n times and then the mediate is
 * returned.
 *
 * This is explained in a greater detail in the "Inspiration"
 * link.
