[Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "wp: Charles_Babbage"),
looking ahead to the sorts of problems his Analytical Engine would be able to
solve, gave this example:

> What is the smallest positive integer whose square ends in the digits 269,696?
>
> Babbage, letter to Lord Bowden, 1837; see Hollingdale and Tootill, _Electronic
> Computers_, second edition, 1970, p. 125.

He thought the answer might be 99,736, whose square is 9,947,269,696; but he
couldn't be certain.

The task is to find out if Babbage had the right answer.
