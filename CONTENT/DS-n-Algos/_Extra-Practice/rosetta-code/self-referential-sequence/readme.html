      There are several ways to generate a self-referential sequence. One very
      common one (the
      <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Look-and-say%20sequence"
        >Look-and-say sequence</a
      >) is to start with a positive integer, then generate the next term by
      concatenating enumerated groups of adjacent alike digits:
    </p>
    <p>0, 10, 1110, 3110, 132110, 1113122110, 311311222110 …</p>
    <p>The terms generated grow in length geometrically and never converge.</p>
    <p>
      Another way to generate a self-referential sequence is to summarize the
      previous term.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count how many of each alike digit there is, then concatenate the sum and
      digit for each of the sorted enumerated digits. Note that the first five
      terms are the same as for the previous sequence.
    </p>
    <p>0, 10, 1110, 3110, 132110, 13123110, 23124110 …</p>
    <p>
      Sort the digits largest to smallest. Do not include counts of digits that
      do not appear in the previous term.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the seed value, series generated this way always either
      converge to a stable value or to a short cyclical pattern. (For our
      purposes, converge means that an element matches a previously seen
      element.) The sequence shown, with a seed value of 0, converges to a
      stable value of 1433223110 after 11 iterations. The seed value that
      converges most quickly is 22. It goes stable after the first element. (The
      next element is 22, which has been seen before.)
