# Longest common subsequence

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/longest-common-subsequence)

The **longest common subsequence** (or
[**LCS**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)) of
groups A and B is the longest group of elements from A and B that are common
between the two groups and in the same order in each group. For example, the
sequences "1234" and "1224533324" have an LCS of "1234":

_**1234**_

_**12**\_245_**3**_332_**4**\_

For a string example, consider the sequences "thisisatest" and
"testing123testing". An LCS would be "tsitest":

_**t**\_hi_**si**_sa_**test**\_

_**t**\_e_**s**_t_**i**_ng123_**test**\_ing.

Your code only needs to deal with strings.
