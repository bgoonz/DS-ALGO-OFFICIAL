# Accumulator factory

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/accumulator-factory)

A problem posed by
[Paul Graham](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)>) is that
of creating a function that takes a single (numeric) argument and which returns
another function that is an accumulator. The returned accumulator function in
turn also takes a single numeric argument, and returns the sum of all the
numeric values passed in so far to that accumulator (including the initial value
passed when the accumulator was created).
