# Ludic numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/ludic-numbers)

[Ludic numbers](https://oeis.org/wiki/Ludic_numbers) are related to prime
numbers as they are generated by a sieve quite like the
[Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is
used to generate prime numbers.

The first ludic number is 1.

To generate succeeding ludic numbers create an array of increasing integers
starting from 2.

`2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ...`

(Loop)

- Take the first member of the resultant array as the next ludic number 2.
- Remove every **2nd** indexed item from the array (including the first).
  `~2~ 3 ~4~ 5 ~6~ 7 ~8~ 9 ~10~ 11 ~12~ 13 ~14~ 15 ~16~ 17 ~18~ 19 ~20~ 21 ~22~ 23 ~24~ 25 ~26~ ...`

- (Unrolling a few loops...)
- Take the first member of the resultant array as the next ludic number 3.
- Remove every **3rd** indexed item from the array (including the first).
  `~3~ 5 7 ~9~ 11 13 ~15~ 17 19 ~21~ 23 25 ~27~ 29 31 ~33~ 35 37 ~39~ 41 43 ~45~ 47 49 ~51~ ...`

- Take the first member of the resultant array as the next ludic number 5.
- Remove every **5th** indexed item from the array (including the first).
  `~5~ 7 11 13 17 ~19~ 23 25 29 31 ~35~ 37 41 43 47 ~49~ 53 55 59 61 ~65~ 67 71 73 77 ...`

- Take the first member of the resultant array as the next ludic number 7.
- Remove every **7th** indexed item from the array (including the first).
  `~7~ 11 13 17 23 25 29 ~31~ 37 41 43 47 53 55 ~59~ 61 67 71 73 77 83 ~85~ 89 91 97 ...`

- **...**
- Take the first member of the current array as the next ludic number L.
- Remove every **Lth** indexed item from the array (including the first).
- **...**
