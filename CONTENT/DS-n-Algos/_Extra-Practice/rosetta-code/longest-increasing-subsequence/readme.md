# Longest increasing subsequence

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/longest-increasing-subsequence)

The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given
sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to
highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. An example:

For the following array:

$\\{3, 10, 2, 1, 20\\}$

Longest increasing sequence is:

$\\{3, 10, 20\\}$
