# Straddling checkerboard

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/straddling-checkerboard)

Implement functions to encrypt and decrypt a message using the
[straddling checkerboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straddling_checkerboard)
method. The functions will take a string and an array as parameters. The array
has 3 strings representing the 3 rows of the checkerboard. The output will be a
series of decimal digits. Numbers should be encrypted by inserting the escape
character before each digit, then including the digit unencrypted. This should
be reversed for decryption.
