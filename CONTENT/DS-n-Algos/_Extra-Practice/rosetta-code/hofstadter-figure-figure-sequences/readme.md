# Hofstadter Figure-Figure sequences

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/hofstadter-figure-figure-sequences)

These two sequences of positive integers are defined as:

$R(1)=1\\ ;\\ S(1)=2 \\\\R(n)=R(n-1)+S(n-1), \\quad n>1.$

The sequence $S(n)$ is further defined as the sequence of positive integers not
present in $R(n)$.

Sequence $R$ starts:

1, 3, 7, 12, 18, ...

Sequence $S$ starts:

2, 4, 5, 6, 8, ...
