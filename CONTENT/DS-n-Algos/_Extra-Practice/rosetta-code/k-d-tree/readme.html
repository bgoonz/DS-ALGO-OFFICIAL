<p>A k-d tree (short for <em>k</em>-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees. k-d trees are not suitable, however, for efficiently finding the nearest neighbor in high dimensional spaces. As a general rule, if the dimensionality is <em>k</em>, the number of points in the data, <em>N</em>, should be <em>N</em> ≫ 2<em>k</em>. Otherwise, when k-d trees are used with high-dimensional data, most of the points in the tree will be evaluated and the efficiency is no better than exhaustive search, and other methods such as approximate nearest-neighbor are used instead.</p>
