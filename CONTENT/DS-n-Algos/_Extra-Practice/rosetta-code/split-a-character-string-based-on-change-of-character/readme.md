# Split a character string based on change of character

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/split-a-character-string-based-on-change-of-character)

Split a (character) string into comma (plus a blank) delimited strings based on
a change of character (left to right). Blanks should be treated as any other
character (except they are problematic to display clearly). The same applies to
commas. For instance, the string:

"gHHH5YY++///\\\\"

should be split as:

\["g", "HHH", "5", "YY", "++", "///", "\\\\" \];
