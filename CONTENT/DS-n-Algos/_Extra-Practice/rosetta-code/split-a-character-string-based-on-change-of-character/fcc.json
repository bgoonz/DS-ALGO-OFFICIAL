Blanks should be treated as any other character (except they are problematic to display clearly). The same applies to commas. For instance, the string:</p>\n<pre>\n\"gHHH5YY++///\\\\\"\n</pre>\n<p>should be split as:</p>\n<pre>\n[\"g\", \"HHH\", \"5\", \"YY\", \"++\", \"///\", \"\\\\\" ];\n</pre>\n</section>",
