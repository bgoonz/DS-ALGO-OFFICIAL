<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look%20and%20say%20sequence">Look and say sequence</a> is a recursively defined sequence of numbers.</p>
<p>Sequence Definition</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a decimal number</li>
<li>Look at the number, visually grouping consecutive runs of the same digit.</li>
<li>Say the number, from left to right, group by group; as how many of that digit there are - followed by the digit grouped.</li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes the next number of the sequence.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with the number 1, you have one 1 which produces 11</li>
<li>Starting with 11, you have two 1’s. I.E.: 21</li>
<li>Starting with 21, you have one 2, then one 1. I.E.: (12)(11) which becomes 1211</li>
<li>Starting with 1211, you have one 1, one 2, then two 1’s. I.E.: (11)(12)(21) which becomes 111221</li>
</ul>
