# Sorting algorithms/Bead sort

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/sorting-algorithmsbead-sort)

Sort an array of positive integers using the
[Bead Sort Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead_sort).

A _bead sort_ is also known as a _gravity sort_.

The algorithm has O(S), where S is the sum of the integers in the input set:
Each bead is moved individually.

This is the case when bead sort is implemented without a mechanism to assist in
finding empty spaces below the beads, such as in software implementations.
