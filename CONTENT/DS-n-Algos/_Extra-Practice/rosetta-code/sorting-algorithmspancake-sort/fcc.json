The function should return the sorted array.</p>\n<p>In short, instead of individual elements being sorted, the only operation allowed is to \"flip\" one end of the list, like so:</p>\n<pre>Before:\n<b>6 7 8 9</b> 2 5 3 4 1<br>\nAfter:\n<b>9 8 7 6</b> 2 5 3 4 1\n</pre>\n<p>Only one end of the list can be flipped; this should be the low end, but the high end is okay if it's easier to code or works better, but it <strong>must</strong> be the same end for the entire solution. (The end flipped can't be arbitrarily changed.)</p>\n</section>",
