<p>A thief burgles a butcherâ€™s shop, where he can select from some items.</p>
<p>The thief knows the weights and prices of each items. Because he has a knapsack with a limit on the maximum weight that it can carry, he wants to select the items such that he would have his profit maximized. He may cut the items; the item has a reduced price after cutting that is proportional to the original price by the ratio of masses. That means: half of an item has half the price of the original.</p>
