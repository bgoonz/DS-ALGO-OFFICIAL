# Knapsack problem/Continuous

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/knapsack-problemcontinuous)

A thief burgles a butcher's shop, where he can select from some items.

The thief knows the weights and prices of each items. Because he has a knapsack
with a limit on the maximum weight that it can carry, he wants to select the
items such that he would have his profit maximized. He may cut the items; the
item has a reduced price after cutting that is proportional to the original
price by the ratio of masses. That means: half of an item has half the price of
the original.
