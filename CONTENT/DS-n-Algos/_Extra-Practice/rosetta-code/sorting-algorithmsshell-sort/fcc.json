The function should return the sorted array.</p>\n<p>The Shell sort (also known as Shellsort or Shell's method) is named after its inventor, Donald Shell, who published the algorithm in 1959.</p>\n<p>Shell sort is a sequence of interleaved insertion sorts based on an increment sequence. The increment size is reduced after each pass until the increment size is 1.</p>\n<p>With an increment size of 1, the sort is a basic insertion sort, but by this time the data is guaranteed to be almost sorted, which is insertion sort's \"best case\".</p>\n<p>Any sequence will sort the data as long as it ends in 1, but some work better than others.</p>\n<p>Empirical studies have shown a geometric increment sequence with a ratio of about 2.2 work well in practice.</p>\n</section>",
