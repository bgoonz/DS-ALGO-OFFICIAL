# State name puzzle

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/state-name-puzzle)

This task is inspired by Mark Nelson's DDJ Column "Wordplay" and one of the
weekly puzzle challenges from Will Shortz on NPR Weekend Edition
[\[1\]](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9264290) and
originally attributed to David Edelheit. The challenge was to take the names of
two U.S. States, mix them all together, then rearrange the letters to form the
names of two _different_ U.S. States (so that all four state names differ from
one another). What states are these? The problem was reissued on
[the Unicon Discussion Web](https://tapestry.tucson.az.us/twiki/bin/view/Main/StateNamesPuzzle)
which includes several solutions with analysis. Several techniques may be
helpful and you may wish to refer to
[GÃ¶del numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goedel_numbering),
[equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation), and
[equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_classes). The
basic merits of these were discussed in the Unicon Discussion Web. A second
challenge in the form of a set of fictitious new states was also presented.
