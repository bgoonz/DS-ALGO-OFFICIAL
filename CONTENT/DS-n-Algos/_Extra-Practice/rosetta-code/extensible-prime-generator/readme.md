# Extensible prime generator

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/extensible-prime-generator)

Write a generator of prime numbers, in order, that will automatically adjust to
accommodate the generation of any reasonably high prime.

The generator should be able to:

- Show the first `n` prime numbers
- Show the prime numbers in a range
- Show the number of primes in a range
- Show the `nth` prime number

The function should have two parameters. The first will receive `n` or the range
as an array. The second will receive a boolean, that specifies if the function
returns the prime numbers as an array or a single number(the number of primes in
the range or the `nth` prime). According to the parameters the function should
return an array.
