If N &#x3C; 2 then consolidation has no strict meaning and the input can be returned.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n<p>Given the two sets <code>{A,B}</code> and <code>{C,D}</code> then there is no common element between the sets and the result is the same as the input.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n<p>Given the two sets <code>{A,B}</code> and <code>{B,D}</code> then there is a common element <code>B</code> between the sets and the result is the single set <code>{B,D,A}</code>. (Note that order of items in a set is immaterial: <code>{A,B,D}</code> is the same as <code>{B,D,A}</code> and <code>{D,A,B}</code>, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n<p>Given the three sets <code>{A,B}</code> and <code>{C,D}</code> and <code>{D,B}</code> then there is no common element between the sets <code>{A,B}</code> and <code>{C,D}</code> but the sets <code>{A,B}</code> and <code>{D,B}</code> do share a common element that consolidates to produce the result <code>{B,D,A}</code>. On examining this result with the remaining set, <code>{C,D}</code>, they share a common element and so consolidate to the final output of the single set <code>{A,B,C,D}</code></p>\n<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>\n<p>The consolidation of the five sets:</p>\n<p><code>{H,I,K}</code>, <code>{A,B}</code>, <code>{C,D}</code>, <code>{D,B}</code>, and <code>{F,G,H}</code></p>\n<p>Is the two sets:</p>\n<p><code>{A, C, B, D}</code>, and <code>{G, F, I, H, K}</code></p>\n</section>",
