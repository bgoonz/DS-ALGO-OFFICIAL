# Harshad or Niven series

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/harshad-or-niven-series)

The Harshad or Niven numbers are positive integers â‰¥ 1 that are divisible by the
sum of their digits.

For example, `42` is a Harshad number as `42` is divisible by `(4 + 2)` without
remainder.

Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.
