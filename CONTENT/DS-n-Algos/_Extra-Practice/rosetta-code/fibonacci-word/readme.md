[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/fibonacci-word)

The Fibonacci Word may be created in a manner analogous to the Fibonacci
Sequence
[as described here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/36/79/72/PDF/The_Fibonacci_word_fractal.pdf):

Define F_Word1 as **1** Define F_Word2 as **0** Form F_Word3 as F_Word2
concatenated with F_Word1 i.e.: **01** Form F_Wordn as F_Wordn-1 concatenated
with F_wordn-2
