# Sum of a series

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/sum-of-a-series)

Compute the **n**th term of a
[series](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series%20(mathematics)>), i.e. the sum
of the **n** first terms of the corresponding
[sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sequence). Informally this value, or
its limit when **n** tends to infinity, is also called the _sum of the series_,
thus the title of this task. For this task, use:
$S\_n = \\displaystyle\\sum\_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2}$.
