<p><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/eso:Subleq">Subleq</a> is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer">One-Instruction Set Computer (OISC)</a>.</p>
<p>It is named after its only instruction, which is <strong>SU</strong>btract and <strong>B</strong>ranch if <strong>L</strong>ess than or <strong>EQ</strong>ual</p>
<p>to zero.</p>
<p>Your task is to create an interpreter which emulates such a machine.</p>
<p>The machine’s memory consists of an array of signed integers. Any reasonable word size is fine, but the memory must be</p>
<p>able to hold negative as well as positive numbers.</p>
<p>Execution begins with the instruction pointer aimed at the first word, which is address 0. It proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let A, B, and C be the value stored in the three consecutive words in memory starting at the instruction pointer.</li>
<li>Advance the instruction pointer 3 words to point at the address after the one containing C.</li>
<li>If A is -1, then a character is read from standard input and its code point stored in the address given by B. C is unused.</li>
<li>If B is -1, then the number contained in the address given by A is interpreted as a code point and the corresponding character output. C is again unused.</li>
<li>Otherwise, both A and B are treated as the addresses of memory locations. The number contained in the address given by A is subtracted from the number at the address given by B (and the result stored back in address B). If the result is zero or negative, the value C becomes the new instruction pointer.</li>
<li>If the instruction pointer becomes negative, execution halts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other negative addresses besides -1 may be treated as equivalent to -1, or generate an error, as you see fit.</p>
<p>Your solution should accept a program to execute on the machine, separately from the input fed to the program itself.</p>
<p>This program should be in raw subleq “machine code” - whitespace-separated decimal numbers, with no symbolic names or</p>
<p>other assembly-level extensions, to be loaded into memory starting at address 0. Show the output of your solution when</p>
<p>fed this “Hello, world!” program. (Note that the example assumes ASCII or a superset of it, such as any of the Latin-N</p>
<p>character sets or Unicode. You may translate it into another character set if your implementation is on a</p>
<p>non-ASCiI-compatible environment.)</p>
<p>15 17 -1 17 -1 -1 16 1 -1 16 3 -1 15 15 0 0 -1 72 101 108 108 111 44 32 119 111 114 108 100 33 10 0</p>
<p>Which corresponds to something like this in a hypothetical assembler language:</p>
<p>start: zero, message, -1 message, -1, -1 neg1, start+1, -1 neg1, start+3, -1 zero, zero, start zero: 0 neg1: -1 message: “Hello, world!\n\0”</p>
