A 'zig-zag' array is a square arrangement of the first $N^2$ integers, where the
numbers increase sequentially as you zig-zag along the array's
[anti-diagonals](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antidiagonal).

For example, for the input `5`, the following result should be produced:

0 1 5 6 14 2 4 7 13 15 3 8 12 16 21 9 11 17 20 22 10 18 19 23 24
