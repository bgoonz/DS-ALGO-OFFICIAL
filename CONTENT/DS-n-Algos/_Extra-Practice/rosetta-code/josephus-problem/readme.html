      >
      is a math puzzle with a grim description:
      <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> prisoners are standing on a
      circle, sequentially numbered from <span class="math inline">0</span> to
      <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner
      <span class="math inline">0</span>, removing every
      <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span
      >-th prisoner and killing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the process goes on, the circle becomes smaller and smaller, until only
      one prisoner remains, who is then freed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if there are
      <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 5</span> prisoners and
      <span class="math inline"><em>k</em> = 2</span>, the order the prisoners
      are killed in (let’s call it the “killing sequence”) will be 1, 3, 0, and
      4, and the survivor will be #2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given any <span class="math inline"><em>n</em>, <em>k</em> &gt; 0</span>,
      find out which prisoner will be the final survivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one such incident, there were 41 prisoners and every 3rd prisoner was
      being killed (<span class="math inline"><em>k</em> = 3</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them was a clever chap name Josephus who worked out the problem,
      stood at the surviving position, and lived on to tell the tale.
    </p>
    <p>Which number was he?</p>
