[Knight's Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) Problem: You have
an empty `w` \* `h` chessboard, but for a single knight on some square. The
knight must perform a sequence of legal moves that result in the knight visiting
every square on the chessboard exactly once. Note that it is _not_ a requirement
that the tour be "closed"; that is, the knight need not end within a single move
of its start position.
