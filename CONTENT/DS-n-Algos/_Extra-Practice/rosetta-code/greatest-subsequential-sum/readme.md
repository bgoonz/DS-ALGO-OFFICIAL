# Greatest subsequential sum

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/greatest-subsequential-sum)

Given a sequence of integers, find a continuous subsequence which maximizes the
sum of its elements, that is, the elements of no other single subsequence add up
to a value larger than this one.

An empty subsequence is considered to have the sum of \\( 0 \\); thus if all
elements are negative, the result must be the empty sequence.
