# Gaussian elimination

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/gaussian-elimination)

Write a function to solve \\(Ax = b\\) using Gaussian elimination then backwards
substitution.

\\(A\\) being an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. Also, \\(x\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(n\\)
by 1 vectors.

To improve accuracy, please use partial pivoting and scaling.
