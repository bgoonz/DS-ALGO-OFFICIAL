The
[International Bank Account Number (IBAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number)
is an internationally agreed means of identifying bank accounts across national
borders with a reduced risk of propagating
[transcription errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_error).

The IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters:

- first the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
- then two check digits, and
- finally a country-specific Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN).

The check digits enable a sanity check of the bank account number to confirm its
integrity even before submitting a transaction.
