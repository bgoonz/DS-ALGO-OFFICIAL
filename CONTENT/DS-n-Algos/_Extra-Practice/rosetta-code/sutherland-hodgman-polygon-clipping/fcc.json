  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland-Hodgman%20clipping%20algorithm\">Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm</a> finds the polygon that is the intersection between an arbitrary polygon (the \"subject polygon\") and a convex polygon (the \"clip polygon\"). It is used in computer graphics (especially 2D graphics) to reduce the complexity of a scene being displayed by eliminating parts of a polygon that do not need to be displayed. Take the closed polygon defined by the points:</p>\n<pre>[(50, 150), (200, 50), (350, 150), (350, 300), (250, 300), (200, 250), (150, 350), (100, 250), (100, 200)]</pre>\n<p>and clip it by the rectangle defined by the points:</p>\n<pre>[(100, 100), (300, 100), (300, 300), (100, 300)]</pre>\n</section>",
