    <p>
      There is a highly organized city that has decided to assign a number to
      each of their departments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Police department</li>
      <li>Sanitation department</li>
      <li>Fire department</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each department can have a number between 1 and 7 (inclusive).</p>
    <p>
      The three department numbers are to be unique (different from each other)
      and must add up to the number 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief of the Police doesnâ€™t like odd numbers and wants to have an even
      number for his department.
