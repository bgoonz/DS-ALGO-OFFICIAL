# Department Numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/department-numbers)

There is a highly organized city that has decided to assign a number to each of
their departments:

- Police department
- Sanitation department
- Fire department

Each department can have a number between 1 and 7 (inclusive).

The three department numbers are to be unique (different from each other) and
must add up to the number 12.

The Chief of the Police doesn't like odd numbers and wants to have an even
number for his department.
