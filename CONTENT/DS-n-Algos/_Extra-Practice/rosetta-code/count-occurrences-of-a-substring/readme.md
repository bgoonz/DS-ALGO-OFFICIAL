# Count occurrences of a substring

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/count-occurrences-of-a-substring)

Create a function, or show a built-in function, to count the number of
non-overlapping occurrences of a substring inside a string.

The function should take two arguments:

- the first argument being the string to search, and
- the second a substring to be searched for.

It should return an integer count.

The matching should yield the highest number of non-overlapping matches.

In general, this essentially means matching from left-to-right or right-to-left.
