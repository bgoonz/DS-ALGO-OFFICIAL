# Loop over multiple arrays simultaneously

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/loop-over-multiple-arrays-simultaneously)

Loop over multiple arrays and create a new array whose $i^{th}$ element is the
concatenation of $i^{th}$ element of each of the given.

For this example, if you are given this array of arrays:

```js
[
  ["a", "b", "c"],
  ["A", "B", "C"],
  [1, 2, 3],
];
```

the output should be:

```js
["aA1", "bB2", "cC3"];
```
