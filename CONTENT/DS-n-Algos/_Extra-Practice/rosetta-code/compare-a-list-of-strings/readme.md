# Compare a list of strings

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/compare-a-list-of-strings)

Given a
[list](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)> "wp: List_(abstract_data_type)")
of arbitrarily many strings, implement a function for each of the following
conditions:

- test if they are all lexically equal
- test if every string is lexically less than the one after it (i.e. whether the
  list is in strict ascending order)
