**SHA-1** or **SHA1** is a one-way hash function; it computes a 160-bit message
digest.

SHA-1 often appears in security protocols; for example, many HTTPS websites use
RSA with SHA-1 to secure their connections.

BitTorrent uses SHA-1 to verify downloads.

Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 digests to identify commits.

A US government standard,
[FIPS 180-1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SHA-1/FIPS-180-1), defines SHA-1.
