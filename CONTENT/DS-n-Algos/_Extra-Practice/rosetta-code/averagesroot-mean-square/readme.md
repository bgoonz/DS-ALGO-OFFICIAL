Compute the
[Root mean square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root%20mean%20square "wp: Root mean square")
of the numbers 1 through 10 inclusive.

The _root mean square_ is also known by its initials RMS (or rms), and as the
**quadratic mean**.

The RMS is calculated as the mean of the squares of the numbers, square-rooted:

$$x\_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt {{{x\_1}^2 + {x\_2}^2 + \\cdots + {x\_n}^2} \\over n}. $$
