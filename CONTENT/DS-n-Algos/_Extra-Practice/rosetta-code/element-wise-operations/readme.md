# Element-wise operations

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/element-wise-operations)

Implement basic element-wise matrix-matrix and scalar-matrix operations.

**Implement:**

- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- exponentiation

The first parameter will be the operation to be performed, for example, "m_add"
for matrix addition and "s_add" for scalar addition. The second and third
parameters will be the matrices on which the operations are to be performed.
