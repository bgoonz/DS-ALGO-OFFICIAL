  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The least common multiple of 12 and 18 is 36, because 12 is a factor (12 × 3 = 36), and 18 is a factor (18 × 2 = 36), and there is no positive integer less than 36 that has both factors. As a special case, if either <em>m</em> or <em>n</em> is zero, then the least common multiple is zero. One way to calculate the least common multiple is to iterate all the multiples of <em>m</em>, until you find one that is also a multiple of <em>n</em>. If you already have <em>gcd</em> for <a href=\"https://rosettacode.org/wiki/greatest%20common%20divisor\">greatest common divisor</a>, then this formula calculates <em>lcm</em>. ( \\operatorname{lcm}(m, n) = \\frac{|m \\times n|}{\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)} )</p>\n</section>",
