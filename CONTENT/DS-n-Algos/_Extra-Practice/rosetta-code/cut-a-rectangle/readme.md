# Cut a rectangle

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/cut-a-rectangle)

A given rectangle is made from _m_ × _n_ squares. If _m_ and _n_ are not both
odd, then it is possible to cut a path through the rectangle along the square
edges such that the rectangle splits into two connected pieces with the same
shape (after rotating one of the pieces by 180°). All such paths for 2 × 2 and 4
× 3 rectangles are shown below.

fill-opacity: .4 } .s2 { fill: #fbf } .d { stroke:black; fill:none}
