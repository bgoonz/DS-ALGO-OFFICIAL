# Symmetric difference

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/symmetric-difference)

Given two [set](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/set)s _A_ and _B_, compute
$(A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A).$ That is, enumerate the items that are
in _A_ or _B_ but not both. This set is called the
[symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric%20difference) of
_A_ and _B_. In other words: $(A \\cup B) \\setminus (A \\cap B)$ (the set of
items that are in at least one of _A_ or _B_ minus the set of items that are in
both _A_ and _B_).
