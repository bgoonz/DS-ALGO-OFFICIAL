# Averages/Mode

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/averagesmode)

Write a program to find the
[mode](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode%20(statistics)> "wp: Mode (statistics)")
value of a collection.

The case where the collection is empty may be ignored. Care must be taken to
handle the case where the mode is non-unique.

If it is not appropriate or possible to support a general collection, use a
vector (array), if possible. If it is not appropriate or possible to support an
unspecified value type, use integers.
