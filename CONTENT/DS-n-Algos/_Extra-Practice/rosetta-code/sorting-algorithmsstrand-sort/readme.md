# Sorting algorithms/Strand sort

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/sorting-algorithmsstrand-sort)

Write a function to sort an array using the
[Strand sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand%20sort). The function should
return the sorted array.

This is a way of sorting numbers by extracting shorter sequences of already
sorted numbers from an unsorted list.
