# Align columns

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/align-columns)

Given a text file of many lines, where fields within a line are delineated by a
single `$` character, write a program that aligns each column of fields by
ensuring that words in each column are separated by at least one space. Further,
allow for each word in a column to be either left justified, right justified, or
center justified within its column.
