    <p>
      Soundex is an algorithm for creating indices for words based on their
      pronunciation. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same
      representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in
      spelling (from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soundex">the WP article</a>). There
      is a major issue in many of the implementations concerning the separation
      of two consonants that have the same soundex code! According to the
      <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html"
        >official Rules</a
      >. So check for instance if <strong>Ashcraft</strong> is coded to
      <strong>A-261</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) separates two consonants that have the same
        soundex code, the consonant to the right of the vowel is coded. Tymczak
        is coded as T-522 (T, 5 for the M, 2 for the C, Z ignored (see
        “Side-by-Side” rule above), 2 for the K). Since the vowel “A” separates
        the Z and K, the K is coded.
      </li>
      <li>
        If “H” or “W” separate two consonants that have the same soundex code,
        the consonant to the right of the vowel is not coded. Example: Ashcraft
        is coded A-261 (A, 2 for the S, C ignored, 6 for the R, 1 for the F). It
        is not coded A-226.
