# Topological sort

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/topological-sort)

Given a mapping between items, and items they depend on, a
[topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological%20sorting "wp: Topological sorting")
orders items so that no item precedes an item it depends upon. The compiling of
a library in the [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL "wp: VHDL") language
has the constraint that a library must be compiled after any library it depends
on.
