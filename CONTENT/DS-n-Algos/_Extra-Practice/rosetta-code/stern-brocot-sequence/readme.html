<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/stern-brocot-sequence">FCC link</a></p>
<p>For this task, the Stern-Brocot sequence is to be generated by an algorithm similar to that employed in generating the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci%20sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first and second members of the sequence are both 1:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1, 1</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Start by considering the second member of the sequence</li>
<li>Sum the considered member of the sequence and its precedent, (1 + 1) = 2, and append it to the end of the sequence:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1, 1, 2</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Append the considered member of the sequence to the end of the sequence:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1, 1, 2, 1</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Consider the next member of the series, (the third member i.e. 2)</li>
<li>GOTO 3</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>─── Expanding another loop we get: ───</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Sum the considered member of the sequence and its precedent, (2 + 1) = 3, and append it to the end of the sequence:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1, 1, 2, 1, 3</li>
</ul>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>Append the considered member of the sequence to the end of the sequence:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2</li>
</ul>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Consider the next member of the series, (the fourth member i.e. 1)</li>
</ol>
