A [happy number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number) is defined by the
following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares
of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals `1` (where it will
stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include `1`. Those
numbers for which this process ends in `1` are happy numbers, while those that
do not end in `1` are unhappy numbers.
