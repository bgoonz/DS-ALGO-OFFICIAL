# Gray code

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/gray-code)

[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray%20code) is a form of binary
encoding where transitions between consecutive numbers differ by only one bit.

This is a useful encoding for reducing hardware data hazards with values that
change rapidly and/or connect to slower hardware as inputs.

It is also useful for generating inputs for
[Karnaugh maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh%20map) in order from left
to right or top to bottom.
