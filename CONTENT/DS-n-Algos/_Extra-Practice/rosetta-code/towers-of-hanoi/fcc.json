The function should return an array of arrays containing the list of moves, source -> destination.</p>\n<p>For example, the array <code>[['A', 'C'], ['B', 'A']]</code> indicates that the 1st move was to move a disc from stack A to C, and the 2nd move was to move a disc from stack B to A.</p>\n<p></p>\n</section>",
