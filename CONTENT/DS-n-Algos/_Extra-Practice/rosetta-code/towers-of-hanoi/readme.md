Solve the
[Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_Hanoi "wp: Towers_of_Hanoi")
problem.

Your solution should accept the number of discs as the first parameters, and
three string used to identify each of the three stacks of discs, for example
`towerOfHanoi(4, 'A', 'B', 'C')`. The function should return an array of arrays
containing the list of moves, source -> destination.

For example, the array `[['A', 'C'], ['B', 'A']]` indicates that the 1st move
was to move a disc from stack A to C, and the 2nd move was to move a disc from
stack B to A.
