Produce a spiral array. A _spiral array_ is a square arrangement of the first N2
natural numbers, where the numbers increase sequentially as you go around the
edges of the array spiraling inwards. For example, given **5**, produce this
array:

0 1 2 3 4 15 16 17 18 5 14 23 24 19 6 13 22 21 20 7 12 11 10 9 8
