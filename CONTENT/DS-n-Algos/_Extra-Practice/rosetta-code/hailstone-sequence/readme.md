# Hailstone sequence

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/hailstone-sequence)

The Hailstone sequence of numbers can be generated from a starting positive
integer, `n` by:

- If `n` is `1` then the sequence ends
- If `n` is `even` then the next `n` of the sequence `= n/2`
- If `n` is `odd` then the next `n` of the sequence `= (3 * n) + 1`

The (unproven) Collatz conjecture is that the hailstone sequence for any
starting number always terminates.

The hailstone sequence is also known as hailstone numbers (because the values
are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a
cloud), or as the Collatz sequence.
