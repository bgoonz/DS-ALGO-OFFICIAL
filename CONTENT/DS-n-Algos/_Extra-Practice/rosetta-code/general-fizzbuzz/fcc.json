  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Write a generalized version of <a href=\"https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz\">FizzBuzz</a> that works for any list of factors, along with their words.</p>\n<p>This is basically a \"fizzbuzz\" implementation where the rules of the game are supplied to the user. Create a function to implement this. The function should take two parameters.</p>\n<p>The first will be an array with the FizzBuzz rules. For example: <code>[ [3, \"Fizz\"] , [5, \"Buzz\"] ]</code>.</p>\n<p>This indicates that <code>Fizz</code> should be printed if the number is a multiple of 3 and <code>Buzz</code> if it is a multiple of 5. If it is a multiple of both then the strings should be concatenated in the order specified in the array. In this case, <code>FizzBuzz</code> if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5.</p>\n<p>The second parameter is the number for which the function should return a string as stated above.</p>\n</section>",
