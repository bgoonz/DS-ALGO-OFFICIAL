# Left factorials

**Left factorials**, $ !n $, may refer to either _subfactorials_ or to
_factorial sums_. The same notation can be confusingly seen used for the two
different definitions. Sometimes, _subfactorials_ (also known as _derangements_)
may use any of the notations:

- $!n\`$
- $!n$
- $nยก$

(It may not be visually obvious, but the last example uses an upside-down
exclamation mark.) This task will be using this formula for **left factorial**:

$ !n = \\sum\_{k=0}^{n-1} k! $

where $!0 = 0$
