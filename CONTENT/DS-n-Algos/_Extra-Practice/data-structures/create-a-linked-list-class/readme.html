<h1 id="create-a-linked-list-class">Create a Linked List Class</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/create-a-linked-list-class">FCC link</a></p>
<p>Let’s create a <code>linked list</code> class. Every linked list should start out with a few basic properties: a <code>head</code> (the first item in your list) and a <code>length</code> (number of items in your list). Sometimes you’ll see implementations of linked lists that incorporate a <code>tail</code> for the last element of the list, but for now we’ll just stick with these two. Whenever we add an element to the linked list, our <code>length</code> property should be incremented by one.</p>
<p>We’ll want to have a way to add items to our linked list, so the first method we’ll want to create is the <code>add</code> method.</p>
<p>If our list is empty, adding an element to our linked list is straightforward enough: we just wrap that element in a <code>Node</code> class, and we assign that node to the <code>head</code> of our linked list.</p>
<p>But what if our list already has one or more members? How do we add an element to the list? Recall that each node in a linked list has a <code>next</code> property. To add a node to the list, find the last node in the list, and point that last node’s <code>next</code> property at our new node. (Hint: you know you’ve reached the end of a linked list when a node’s <code>next</code> property is <code>null</code>.)</p>
