  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Let's create a <code>linked list</code> class. Every linked list should start out with a few basic properties: a <code>head</code> (the first item in your list) and a <code>length</code> (number of items in your list). Sometimes you'll see implementations of linked lists that incorporate a <code>tail</code> for the last element of the list, but for now we'll just stick with these two. Whenever we add an element to the linked list, our <code>length</code> property should be incremented by one.</p>\n<p>We'll want to have a way to add items to our linked list, so the first method we'll want to create is the <code>add</code> method.</p>\n<p>If our list is empty, adding an element to our linked list is straightforward enough: we just wrap that element in a <code>Node</code> class, and we assign that node to the <code>head</code> of our linked list.</p>\n<p>But what if our list already has one or more members? How do we add an element to the list? Recall that each node in a linked list has a <code>next</code> property. To add a node to the list, find the last node in the list, and point that last node's <code>next</code> property at our new node. (Hint: you know you've reached the end of a linked list when a node's <code>next</code> property is <code>null</code>.)</p>\n</section>",
