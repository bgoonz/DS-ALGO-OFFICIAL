# Perform a Subset Check on Two Sets of Data

In this exercise, we are going to perform a subset test on 2 sets of data. We
will create a method on our `Set` data structure called `isSubsetOf`. This will
compare the first set against the second, and if the first set is fully
contained within the second, it will return `true`.

For example, if `setA = ['a','b']` and `setB = ['a','b','c','d']`, then `setA`
is a subset of `setB`, so `setA.isSubsetOf(setB)` should return `true`.
