      You are probably familiar with stack of books on your table. You have
      likely used the undo feature of a text editor. You are also probably used
      to hitting the back button on your phone to go back to the previous view
      in your app.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know what they all have in common? They all store the data in a way so
      that you can traverse backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The topmost book in the stack was the one that was put there last. If you
      remove that book from your stack’s top, you would expose the book that was
      put there before the last book and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you think about it, in all the above examples, you are getting
      Last-In-First-Out type of service. We will try to mimic this with our
      code.

      This data storage scheme is called a Stack. In particular, we would have
      to implement the <code>push()</code> method that pushes JavaScript objects
      at the top of the stack; and <code>pop()</code> method, that removes the
      JavaScript object that’s at the top of the stack at the current moment.
