# Work with Nodes in a Linked List

Another common data structure you'll run into in computer science is the linked
list. A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called 'nodes',
each of which points to the next. Each node in a linked list contains two key
pieces of information: the `element` itself, and a reference to the next `node`.

Imagine that you are in a conga line. You have your hands on the next person in
the line, and the person behind you has their hands on you. You can see the
person straight ahead of you, but they are blocking the view of the other people
ahead in line. A node is just like a person in a conga line: they know who they
are and they can only see the next person in line, but they are not aware of the
other people ahead or behind them.
