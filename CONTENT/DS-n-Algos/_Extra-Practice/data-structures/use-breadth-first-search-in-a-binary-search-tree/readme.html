      Use Breadth First Search in a Binary Search Tree

      Here we will introduce another tree traversal method: breadth-first
      search. In contrast to the depth-first search methods from the last
      challenge, breadth-first search explores all the nodes in a given level
      within a tree before continuing on to the next level. Typically, queues
      are utilized as helper data structures in the design of breadth-first
      search algorithms.

    <p>
      In this method, we start by adding the root node to a queue. Then we begin
      a loop where we dequeue the first item in the queue, add it to a new
      array, and then inspect both its child subtrees. If its children are not
      null, they are each enqueued. This process continues until the queue is
      empty.
