  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Here we will introduce another tree traversal method: breadth-first search. In contrast to the depth-first search methods from the last challenge, breadth-first search explores all the nodes in a given level within a tree before continuing on to the next level. Typically, queues are utilized as helper data structures in the design of breadth-first search algorithms.</p>\n<p>In this method, we start by adding the root node to a queue. Then we begin a loop where we dequeue the first item in the queue, add it to a new array, and then inspect both its child subtrees. If its children are not null, they are each enqueued. This process continues until the queue is empty.</p>\n</section>",
