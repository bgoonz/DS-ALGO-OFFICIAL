# Create a Doubly Linked List

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/create-a-doubly-linked-list)

All of the linked lists we've created so far are singly linked lists. Here,
we'll create a doubly linked list. As the name implies, nodes in a doubly linked
list have references to the next and previous node in the list.

This allows us to traverse the list in both directions but it also requires more
memory to be used because every node must contain an additional reference to the
previous node in the list.
