# Perform an Intersection on Two Sets of Data

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/perform-an-intersection-on-two-sets-of-data)

In this exercise we are going to perform an intersection on 2 sets of data. We
will create a method on our `Set` data structure called `intersection`. An
intersection of sets represents all values that are common to two or more sets.
This method should take another `Set` as an argument and return the
`intersection` of the two sets.

For example, if `setA = ['a','b','c']` and `setB = ['a','b','d','e']`, then the
intersection of setA and setB is: `setA.intersection(setB) = ['a', 'b']`.
