      Remove Elements from a Linked List by Index

      Before we move on to another data structure, let’s get a couple of last
      bits of practice with linked lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s write a <code>removeAt</code> method that removes the
      <code>element</code> at a given <code>index</code>. The method should be
      called <code>removeAt(index)</code>. To remove an <code>element</code> at
      a certain <code>index</code>, we’ll need to keep a running count of each
      node as we move along the linked list.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common technique used to iterate through the elements of a linked list
      involves a ‘runner’, or sentinel, that ‘points’ at the nodes that your
      code is comparing. In our case, starting at the <code>head</code> of our
      list, we start with a <code>currentIndex</code> variable that starts at
      <code>0</code>. The <code>currentIndex</code> should increment by one for
      each node we pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like our <code>remove(element)</code> method, which
      <a
        href="/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/remove-elements-from-a-linked-list"
        >we covered in a previous lesson</a
      >, we need to be careful not to orphan the rest of our list when we remove
      the node in our <code>removeAt(index)</code> method. We keep our nodes
      contiguous by making sure that the node that has reference to the removed
      node has a reference to the next node.
