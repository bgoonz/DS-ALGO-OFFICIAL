  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Before we move on to another data structure, let's get a couple of last bits of practice with linked lists.</p>\n<p>Let's write a <code>removeAt</code> method that removes the <code>element</code> at a given <code>index</code>. The method should be called <code>removeAt(index)</code>. To remove an <code>element</code> at a certain <code>index</code>, we'll need to keep a running count of each node as we move along the linked list.</p>\n<p>A common technique used to iterate through the elements of a linked list involves a <dfn>'runner'</dfn>, or sentinel, that 'points' at the nodes that your code is comparing. In our case, starting at the <code>head</code> of our list, we start with a <code>currentIndex</code> variable that starts at <code>0</code>. The <code>currentIndex</code> should increment by one for each node we pass.</p>\n<p>Just like our <code>remove(element)</code> method, which <a href=\"/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/remove-elements-from-a-linked-list\">we covered in a previous lesson</a>, we need to be careful not to orphan the rest of our list when we remove the node in our <code>removeAt(index)</code> method. We keep our nodes contiguous by making sure that the node that has reference to the removed node has a reference to the next node.</p>\n</section>",
