      Add Elements at a Specific Index in a Linked List

      Let’s create a addAt(index,element) method that adds an element at a given
      index. Just like how we remove elements at a given index, we need to keep
      track of the currentIndex as we traverse the linked list. When the
      currentIndex matches the given index, we would need to reassign the
      previous node’s next property to reference the new added node. And the new
      node should reference the next node in the currentIndex. Returning to the
      conga line example, a new person wants to join the line, but he wants to
      join in the middle. You are in the middle of the line, so you take your
      hands off of the person ahead of you. The new person walks over and puts
      his hands on the person you once had hands on, and you now have your hands
      on the new person.
