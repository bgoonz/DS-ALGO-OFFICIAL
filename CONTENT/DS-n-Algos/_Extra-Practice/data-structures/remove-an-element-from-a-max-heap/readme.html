      Remove an Element from a Max Heap

      Now that we can add elements to our heap letâ€™s see how we can remove
      elements. Removing and inserting elements both require similar logic. In a
      max heap you will usually want to remove the greatest value, so this
      involves simply extracting it from the root of our tree. This will break
      the heap property of our tree, so we must reestablish it in some way.
      Typically, for a max heap this is done in the following way:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Move the last element in the heap into the root position.</li>
      <li>
        If either child of the root is greater than it, swap the root with the
        child of greater value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue swapping until the parent is greater than both children or you
        reach the last level in the tree.
      </li>
    </ol>
