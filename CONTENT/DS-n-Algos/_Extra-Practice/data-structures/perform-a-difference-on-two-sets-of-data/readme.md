# Perform a Difference on Two Sets of Data

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/perform-a-difference-on-two-sets-of-data)

In this exercise we are going to perform a difference on 2 sets of data. We will
create a method on our `Set` data structure called `difference`. A difference of
sets should compare two sets and return the items present in the first set that
are absent in the second. This method should take another `Set` as an argument
and return the `difference` of the two sets.

For example, if `setA = ['a','b','c']` and `setB = ['a','b','d','e']`, then the
difference of setA and setB is: `setA.difference(setB) = ['c']`.
