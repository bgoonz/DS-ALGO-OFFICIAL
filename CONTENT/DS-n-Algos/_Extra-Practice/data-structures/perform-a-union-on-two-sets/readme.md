# Perform a Union on Two Sets

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/perform-a-union-on-two-sets)

In this exercise we are going to perform a union on two sets of data. We will
create a method on our `Set` data structure called `union`. This method should
take another `Set` as an argument and return the `union` of the two sets,
excluding any duplicate values.

For example, if `setA = ['a','b','c']` and `setB = ['a','b','d','e']`, then the
union of setA and setB is: `setA.union(setB) = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`.
