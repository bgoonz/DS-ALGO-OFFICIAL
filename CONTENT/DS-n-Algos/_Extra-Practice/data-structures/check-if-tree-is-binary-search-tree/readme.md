Since you already know what a binary search tree is, this challenge will
establish how it is you can tell that a tree is a binary search tree or not.

The main distinction of a binary search tree is that the nodes are ordered in an
organized fashion. Nodes have at most 2 child nodes (placed to the right and/or
left) based on if the child node's value is greater than or equal to (right) or
less than (left) the parent node.
