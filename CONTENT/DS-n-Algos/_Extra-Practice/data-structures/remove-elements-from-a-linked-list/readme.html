      Remove Elements from a Linked List

      The next important method that any implementation of a linked list will
      need is a <code>remove</code> method. This method should take the element
      we want to remove as an argument, and then search the list to find and
      remove the node that contains that element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever we remove a node from a linked list, it’s important that we don’t
      accidentally orphan the rest of the list in doing so. Recall that every
      node’s <code>next</code> property points to the node that follows it in
      the list. If we’re removing the middle element, say, we’ll want to make
      sure that we have a connection from that element’s previous node’s
      <code>next</code> property to the middle element’s
      <code>next</code> property (which is the next node in the list!)
    </p>
    <p>
      This might sound really confusing, so let’s return to the conga line
      example so we have a good conceptual model. Picture yourself in a conga
      line, and the person directly in front of you leaves the line. The person
      who just left the line no longer has her hands on anyone in line–and you
      no longer have your hands on the person that left. You step forward and
      put your hands on next person you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the element we wish to remove is the <code>head</code> element, we
      reassign the <code>head</code> to the second node of the linked list.
