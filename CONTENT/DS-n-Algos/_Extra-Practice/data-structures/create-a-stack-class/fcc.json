In this section, we will be creating our own stack class. Although you can use arrays to create stacks, sometimes it is best to limit the amount of control we have with our stacks. Apart from the <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> method, stacks have other useful methods. Let's add a <code>peek</code>, <code>isEmpty</code>, and <code>clear</code> method to our stack class.</p>\n</section>",
