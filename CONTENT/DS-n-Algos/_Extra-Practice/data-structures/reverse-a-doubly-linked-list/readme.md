# Reverse a Doubly Linked List

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/reverse-a-doubly-linked-list)

Let's create one more method for our doubly linked list called reverse which
reverses the list in place. Once the method is executed the head should point to
the previous tail and the tail should point to the previous head. Now, if we
traverse the list from head to tail we should meet the nodes in a reverse order
compared to the original list. Trying to reverse an empty list should return
null.
