  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The binomial coefficients nCk can be arranged in triangular form, Pascal's triangle, like this:</p>\n<p>111121133114641151010511615201561172135352171 .........</p>\n<p>It can be seen that the first eight rows of Pascal's triangle contain twelve distinct numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 21 and 35.</p>\n<p>A positive integer n is called squarefree if no square of a prime divides n. Of the twelve distinct numbers in the first eight rows of Pascal's triangle, all except 4 and 20 are squarefree. The sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first eight rows is 105.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first 51 rows of Pascal's triangle.</p>\n</section>",
