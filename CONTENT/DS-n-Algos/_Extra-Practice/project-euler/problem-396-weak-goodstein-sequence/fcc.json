  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g1, g2, g3, ...} is defined as:</p>\n<p>g1 = n</p>\n<p>for k > 1, gk is obtained by writing gk-1 in base k, interpreting it as a base k + 1 number, and subtracting 1.</p>\n<p>The sequence terminates when gk becomes 0.</p>\n<p>For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}: g1 = 6. g2 = 11 since 6 = 1102, 1103 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11. g3 = 17 since 11 = 1023, 1024 = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17. g4 = 25 since 17 = 1014, 1015 = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.</p>\n<p>and so on.</p>\n<p>It can be shown that every weak Goodstein sequence terminates.</p>\n<p>Let G(n) be the number of nonzero elements in the nth weak Goodstein sequence. It can be verified that G(2) = 3, G(4) = 21 and G(6) = 381. It can also be verified that ΣG(n) = 2517 for 1 ≤ n &#x3C; 8.</p>\n<p>Find the last 9 digits of ΣG(n) for 1 ≤ n &#x3C; 16.</p>\n</section>",
