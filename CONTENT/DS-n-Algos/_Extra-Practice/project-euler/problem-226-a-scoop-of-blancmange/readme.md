[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-226-a-scoop-of-blancmange)

The blancmange curve is the set of points (x,y) such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and ,where
s(x) = the distance from x to the nearest integer.

The area under the blancmange curve is equal to ½, shown in pink in the diagram
below.

Let C be the circle with centre (¼,½) and radius ¼, shown in black in the
diagram.

What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by C?Give your answer rounded
to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh
