<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-477-number-sequence-game">FCC link</a></p>
<p>The number sequence game starts with a sequence S of N numbers written on a line.</p>
<p>Two players alternate turns. At his turn, a player must select and remove either the first or the last number remaining in the sequence.</p>
<p>The player score is the sum of all the numbers he has taken. Each player attempts to maximize his own sum.</p>
<p>If N = 4 and S = {1, 2, 10, 3}, then each player maximizes his score as follows:</p>
<p>Player 1: removes the first number (1)</p>
<p>Player 2: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (3)</p>
<p>Player 1: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (10)</p>
<p>Player 2: removes the remaining number (2)</p>
<p>Player 1 score is 1 + 10 = 11.</p>
<p>Let F(N) be the score of player 1 if both players follow the optimal strategy for the sequence S = {s1, s2, …, sN} defined as:</p>
<p>s1 = 0</p>
<p>si+1 = (si2 + 45) modulo 1 000 000 007</p>
<p>The sequence begins with S = {0, 45, 2070, 4284945, 753524550, 478107844, 894218625, …}.</p>
<p>You are given F(2) = 45, F(4) = 4284990, F(100) = 26365463243, F(104) = 2495838522951.</p>
<p>Find F(108).</p>
