[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-377-sum-of-digits-experience-13)

There are 16 positive integers that do not have a zero in their digits and that
have a digital sum equal to 5, namely:

5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 113, 122, 131, 212, 221, 311, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111
and 11111.

Their sum is 17891.

Let f(n) be the sum of all positive integers that do not have a zero in their
digits and have a digital sum equal to n.

Find $\\displaystyle \\sum\_{i=1}^{17} f(13^i)$. Give the last 9 digits as your
answer.
