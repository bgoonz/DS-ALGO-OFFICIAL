<p>In Plato’s heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line. Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans. A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls. The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.</p>
<p>For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:</p>
<p>You are given the following sequences: t0 = 123456. ti = ti-12, if ti-1 is even ti-12 926252, if ti-1 is odd where ⌊x⌋ is the floor function and is the bitwise XOR operator. bi = ( ti mod 211) + 1.</p>
<p>The first two terms of the last sequence are b1 = 289 and b2 = 145. If we start with b1 and b2 beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves would be required to finish the game.</p>
<p>Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing b1, b2,…, b1500 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.</p>
