# Problem 197: Investigating the behaviour of a recursively defined sequence

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-197-investigating-the-behaviour-of-a-recursively-defined-sequence)

Given is the function f(x) = ⌊230.403243784-x2⌋ × 10-9 ( ⌊ ⌋ is the
floor-function),

the sequence un is defined by u0 = -1 and un+1 = f(un).

Find un + un+1 for n = 1012. Give your answer with 9 digits after the decimal
point.
