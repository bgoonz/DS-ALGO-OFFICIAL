# Problem 217: Balanced Numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-217-balanced-numbers)

A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first ⌈k/2⌉
digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈k/2⌉ digits, where ⌈x⌉, pronounced
ceiling of x, is the smallest integer ≥ x, thus ⌈π⌉ = 4 and ⌈5⌉ = 5.

So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.

Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10n.

Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890.

Find T(47) mod 315
