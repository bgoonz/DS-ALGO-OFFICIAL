<p>The flipping game is a two player game played on a N by N square board.</p>
<p>Each square contains a disk with one side white and one side black.</p>
<p>The game starts with all disks showing their white side.</p>
<p>A turn consists of flipping all disks in a rectangle with the following properties: the upper right corner of the rectangle contains a white disk the rectangle width is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, …) the rectangle height is a triangular number (1, 3, 6, 10, …)</p>
<p>Players alternate turns. A player wins by turning the grid all black.</p>
<p>Let W(N) be the number of winning moves for the first player on a N by N board with all disks white, assuming perfect play. W(1) = 1, W(2) = 0, W(5) = 8 and W(102) = 31395.</p>
<p>For N=5, the first player’s eight winning first moves are:</p>
<p>Find W(106).</p>
