  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.</p>\n<p>Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n, and let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.</p>\n<p>The least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds ten is 17.</p>\n<p>Find the least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds one-million.</p>\n</section>",
