[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-232-the-race)

Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play "The Race". On
Player 1's turn, he tosses the coin once: if it comes up Heads, he scores one
point; if it comes up Tails, he scores nothing. On Player 2's turn, she chooses
a positive integer T and tosses the coin T times: if it comes up all Heads, she
scores 2T-1 points; otherwise, she scores nothing. Player 1 goes first. The
winner is the first to 100 or more points.

On each turn Player 2 selects the number, T, of coin tosses that maximises the
probability of her winning.

What is the probability that Player 2 wins?

Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh .
