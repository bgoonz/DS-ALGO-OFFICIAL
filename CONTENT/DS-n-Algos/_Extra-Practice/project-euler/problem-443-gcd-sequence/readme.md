# Problem 443: GCD sequence

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-443-gcd-sequence)

Let g(n) be a sequence defined as follows: g(4) = 13, g(n) = g(n-1) + gcd(n,
g(n-1)) for n > 4.

The first few values are:

n 4567891011121314151617181920... g(n) 1314161718272829303132333451545560...

You are given that g(1 000) = 2524 and g(1 000 000) = 2624152.

Find g(1015).
