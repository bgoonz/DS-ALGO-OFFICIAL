# Problem 257: Angular Bisectors

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-257-angular-bisectors)

Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a ≤ b ≤ c.

(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).

The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G
(see picture below).

The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller
triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG. It can be proven that for each of these four
triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational. However, there
exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.

How many triangles ABC with perimeter≤100,000,000 exist so that the ratio
area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?
