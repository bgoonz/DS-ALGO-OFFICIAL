  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a ≤ b ≤ c.</p>\n<p>(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).</p>\n<p>The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).</p>\n<p>The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG. It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational. However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.</p>\n<p>How many triangles ABC with perimeter≤100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?</p>\n</section>",
