# Problem 342: The totient of a square is a cube

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-342-the-totient-of-a-square-is-a-cube)

Consider the number 50.

502 = 2500 = 22 × 54, so φ(2500) = 2 × 4 × 53 = 8 × 53 = 23 × 53. 1

So 2500 is a square and φ(2500) is a cube.

Find the sum of all numbers n, 1 < n < 1010 such that φ(n2) is a cube.

1 φ denotes Euler's totient function.
