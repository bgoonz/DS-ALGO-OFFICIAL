<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-349-langtons-ant">FCC link</a></p>
<p>An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or white.</p>
<p>The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following rules:</p>
<p>- if it is on a black square, it flips the color of the square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.</p>
<p>- if it is on a white square, it flips the color of the square to black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.</p>
<p>Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after 1018 moves of the ant?</p>
