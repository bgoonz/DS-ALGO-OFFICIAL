# Problem 355: Maximal coprime subset

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-355-maximal-coprime-subset)

Define Co(n) to be the maximal possible sum of a set of mutually co-prime
elements from {1, 2, ..., n}. For example Co(10) is 30 and hits that maximum on
the subset {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}.

You are given that Co(30) = 193 and Co(100) = 1356.

Find Co(200000).
