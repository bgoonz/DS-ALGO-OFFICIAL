<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-106-special-subset-sums-meta-testing">FCC link</a></p>
<p>Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:</p>
<p>S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.</p>
<p>If B contains more elements than C then S(B) &gt; S(C).</p>
<p>For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.</p>
<p>For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?</p>
<p>NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.</p>
