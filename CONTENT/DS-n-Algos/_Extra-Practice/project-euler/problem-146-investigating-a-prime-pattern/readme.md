# Problem 146: Investigating a Prime Pattern

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-146-investigating-a-prime-pattern)

The smallest positive integer n for which the numbers n2+1, n2+3, n2+7, n2+9,
n2+13, and n2+27 are consecutive primes is 10. The sum of all such integers n
below one-million is 1242490.

What is the sum of all such integers n below 150 million?
