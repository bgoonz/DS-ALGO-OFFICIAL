There are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given below: {2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.</p>\n<p>Let t(n) denote the number of such sequences of length n. You are given that t(10) = 86195 and t(20) = 5227991891.</p>\n<p>Find t(1010) and give your answer modulo 109.</p>\n</section>",
