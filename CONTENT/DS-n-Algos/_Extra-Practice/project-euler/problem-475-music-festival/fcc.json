  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>12n musicians participate at a music festival. On the first day, they form 3n quartets and practice all day.</p>\n<p>It is a disaster. At the end of the day, all musicians decide they will never again agree to play with any member of their quartet.</p>\n<p>On the second day, they form 4n trios, each musician avoiding his previous quartet partners.</p>\n<p>Let f(12n) be the number of ways to organize the trios amongst the 12n musicians. You are given f(12) = 576 and f(24) mod 1 000 000 007 = 509089824.</p>\n<p>Find f(600) mod 1 000 000 007.</p>\n</section>",
