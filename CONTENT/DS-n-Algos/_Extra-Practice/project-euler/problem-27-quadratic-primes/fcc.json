  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:</p>\n<div style='margin-left: 4em;'>$n^2 + n + 41$</div>\n<p>It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \\le n \\le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.</p>\n<p>The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \\le n \\le 79$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.</p>\n<p>Considering quadratics of the form:</p>\n<div style='margin-left: 4em;'>\n  $n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| < range$ and $|b| \\le range$<br>\n  where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$<br>\n  e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$<br>\n</div>\n<p>Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.</p>\n</section>",
