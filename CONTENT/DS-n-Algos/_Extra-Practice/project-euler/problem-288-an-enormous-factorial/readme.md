# Problem 288: An enormous factorial

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-288-an-enormous-factorial)

For any prime p the number N(p,q) is defined by

N(p,q) = âˆ‘n=0 to q Tn\*pn with Tn generated by the following random number
generator:

S0 = 290797 Sn+1 = Sn2 mod 50515093 Tn = Sn mod p

Let Nfac(p,q) be the factorial of N(p,q). Let NF(p,q) be the number of factors p
in Nfac(p,q).

You are given that NF(3,10000) mod 320=624955285.

Find NF(61,107) mod 6110
