  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 2<sup>6972593</sup>−1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2<sup><var>p</var></sup>−1, have been found which contain more digits.</p>\n<p>However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×2<sup>7830457</sup>+1.</p>\n<p>Find the last ten digits of this prime number.</p>\n</section>",
