# Problem 29: Distinct powers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-29-distinct-powers)

Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:

22\=4, 23\=8, 24\=16, 25\=32

32\=9, 33\=27, 34\=81, 35\=243

42\=16, 43\=64, 44\=256, 45\=1024

52\=25, 53\=125, 54\=625, 55\=3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the
following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by `ab` for 2 ≤ `a` ≤ `n`
and 2 ≤ `b` ≤ `n`?
