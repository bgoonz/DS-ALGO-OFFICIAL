  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:</p>\n<p>Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.</p>\n<p>It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.</p>\n<p>Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.</p>\n</section>",
