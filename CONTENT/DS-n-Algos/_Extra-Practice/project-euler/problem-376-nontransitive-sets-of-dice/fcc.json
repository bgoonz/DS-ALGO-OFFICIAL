  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:</p>\n<p>Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4 Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5 Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6</p>\n<p>A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.</p>\n<p>If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2</p>\n<p>If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2</p>\n<p>If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get P(second player wins) = 25/36 > 1/2</p>\n<p>So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning. A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.</p>\n<p>We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and N pips, inclusive. Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located. The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins. The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.</p>\n<p>For N = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets. How many are there for N = 30 ?</p>\n</section>",
