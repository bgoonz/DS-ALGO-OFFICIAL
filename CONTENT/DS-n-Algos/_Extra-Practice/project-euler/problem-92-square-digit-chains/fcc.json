  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<div style='margin-left: 4em;'>\n  44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <strong>1</strong> → <strong>1</strong><br>\n  85 → <strong>89</strong> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <strong>89</strong>\n</div>\n<p>Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.</p>\n<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?</p>\n</section>",
