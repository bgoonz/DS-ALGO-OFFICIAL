# Problem 15: Lattice paths

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-15-lattice-paths)

Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to
the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

![a diagram of 6 2 by 2 grids showing all the routes to the bottom right corner](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/project-euler/1Atixoj.gif)

How many such routes are there through a given `gridSize`?
