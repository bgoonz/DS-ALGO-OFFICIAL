# Problem 99: Largest exponential

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-99-largest-exponential)

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as
any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more
difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using the included 2D array of base/exponent pairs, determine which pair has the
greatest numerical value.

**Note:** The first array in `baseExp` represent the numbers in the example
given above.
