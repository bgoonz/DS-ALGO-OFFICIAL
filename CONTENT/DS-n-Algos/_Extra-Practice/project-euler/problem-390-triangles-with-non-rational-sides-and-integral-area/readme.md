# Problem 390: Triangles with non rational sides and integral area

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-390-triangles-with-non-rational-sides-and-integral-area)

Consider the triangle with sides √5, √65 and √68.

It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.

S(n) is the sum of the areas of all triangles with sides √(1+b2), √(1+c2) and
√(b2+c2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not
exceeding n.

The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.

S(106)=18018206.

Find S(1010).
