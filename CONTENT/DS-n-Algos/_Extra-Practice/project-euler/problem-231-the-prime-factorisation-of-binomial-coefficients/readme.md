# Problem 231: The prime factorisation of binomial coefficients

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-231-the-prime-factorisation-of-binomial-coefficients)

The binomial coefficient 10C3 = 120.

120 = 23 × 3 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5, and 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14.

So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of 10C3 is 14.

Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of 20000000C15000000.
