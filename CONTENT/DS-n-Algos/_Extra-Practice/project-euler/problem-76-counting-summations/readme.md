# Problem 76: Counting summations

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-76-counting-summations)

It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

4 + 1

3 + 2

3 + 1 + 1

2 + 2 + 1

2 + 1 + 1 + 1

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two
positive integers?
