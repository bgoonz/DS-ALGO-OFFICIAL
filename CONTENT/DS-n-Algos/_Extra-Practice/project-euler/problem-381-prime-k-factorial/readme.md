# Problem 381: (prime-k) factorial

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-381-prime-k-factorial)

For a prime p let S(p) = (∑(p-k)!) mod(p) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 5.

For example, if p=7, (7-1)! + (7-2)! + (7-3)! + (7-4)! + (7-5)! = 6! + 5! + 4! +
3! + 2! = 720+120+24+6+2 = 872. As 872 mod(7) = 4, S(7) = 4.

It can be verified that ∑S(p) = 480 for 5 ≤ p < 100.

Find ∑S(p) for 5 ≤ p < 108.
