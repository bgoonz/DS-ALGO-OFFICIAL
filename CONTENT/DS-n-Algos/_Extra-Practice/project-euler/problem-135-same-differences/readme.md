# Problem 135: Same differences

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-135-same-differences)

Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic
progression, the least value of the positive integer, n, for which the equation,
x2 − y2 − z2 = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27:

342 − 272 − 202 = 122 − 92 − 62 = 27

It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.

How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?
