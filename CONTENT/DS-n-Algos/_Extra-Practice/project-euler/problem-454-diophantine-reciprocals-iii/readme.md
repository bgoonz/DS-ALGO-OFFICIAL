[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-454-diophantine-reciprocals-iii)

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers. 1/x + 1/y= 1/n

For a limit L we define F(L) as the number of solutions which satisfy x < y â‰¤ L.

We can verify that F(15) = 4 and F(1000) = 1069. Find F(1012).
