<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-147-rectangles-in-cross-hatched-grids">FCC link</a></p>
<p>In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.</p>
<p>There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e.Â 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids: 1x1: 1 2x1: 4 3x1: 8 1x2: 4 2x2: 18</p>
<p>Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.</p>
<p>How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?</p>
