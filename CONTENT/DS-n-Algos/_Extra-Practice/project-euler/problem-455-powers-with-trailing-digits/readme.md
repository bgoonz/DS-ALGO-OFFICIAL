# Problem 455: Powers With Trailing Digits

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-455-powers-with-trailing-digits)

Let f(n) be the largest positive integer x less than 109 such that the last 9
digits of nx form the number x (including leading zeros), or zero if no such
integer exists.

For example:

f(4) = 411728896 (4411728896 = ...490411728896) f(10) = 0 f(157) = 743757
(157743757 = ...567000743757) Σf(n), 2 ≤ n ≤ 103 = 442530011399 Find Σf(n), 2 ≤
n ≤ 106.
