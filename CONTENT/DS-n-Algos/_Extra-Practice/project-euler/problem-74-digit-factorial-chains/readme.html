<p>The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:</p>
<p>1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:</p>
<p>169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169</p>
<p>871 → 45361 → 871</p>
<p>872 → 45362 → 872</p>
<p>It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,</p>
<p>69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)</p>
<p>78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)</p>
<p>540 → 145 (→ 145)</p>
<p>Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>
<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>
