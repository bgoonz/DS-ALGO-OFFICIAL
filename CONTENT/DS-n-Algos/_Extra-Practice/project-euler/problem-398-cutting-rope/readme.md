# Problem 398: Cutting rope

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-398-cutting-rope)

Inside a rope of length n, n-1 points are placed with distance 1 from each other
and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose m-1 points at random and
cut the rope at these points to create m segments.

Let E(n, m) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment. For example,
E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7. Note that if multiple segments have the same
shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same
as the shortest length.

Find E(107, 100). Give your answer rounded to 5 decimal places behind the
decimal point.
