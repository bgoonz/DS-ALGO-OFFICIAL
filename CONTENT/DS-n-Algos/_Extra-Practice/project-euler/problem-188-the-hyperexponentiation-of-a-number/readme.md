# Problem 188: The hyperexponentiation of a number

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-188-the-hyperexponentiation-of-a-number)

The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer b,
denoted by a↑↑b or ba, is recursively defined by:

a↑↑1 = a,

a↑↑(k+1) = a(a↑↑k).

Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 33 = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 327 = 7625597484987 and 3↑↑4 is
roughly 103.6383346400240996\*10^12. Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.
