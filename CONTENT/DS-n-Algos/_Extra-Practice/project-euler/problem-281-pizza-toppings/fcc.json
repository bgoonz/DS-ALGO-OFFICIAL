  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>You are given a pizza (perfect circle) that has been cut into m·n equal pieces and you want to have exactly one topping on each slice.</p>\n<p>Let f(m,n) denote the number of ways you can have toppings on the pizza with m different toppings (m ≥ 2), using each topping on exactly n slices (n ≥ 1). Reflections are considered distinct, rotations are not.</p>\n<p>Thus, for instance, f(2,1) = 1, f(2,2) = f(3,1) = 2 and f(3,2) = 16. f(3,2) is shown below:</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all f(m,n) such that f(m,n) ≤ 1015.</p>\n</section>",
