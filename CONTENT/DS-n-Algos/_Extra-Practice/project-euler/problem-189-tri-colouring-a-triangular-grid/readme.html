<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-189-tri-colouring-a-triangular-grid">FCC link</a></p>
<p>Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:</p>
<p>We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge. Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.</p>
<p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>
<p>A colouring Câ€™ which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered distinct from C unless the two are identical.</p>
<p>How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>
