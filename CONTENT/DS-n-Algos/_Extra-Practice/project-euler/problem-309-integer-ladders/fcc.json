  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In the classic \"Crossing Ladders\" problem, we are given the lengths x and y of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level street. We are also given the height h above the street where the two ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street (w).</p>\n<p>Here, we are only concerned with instances where all four variables are positive integers. For example, if x = 70, y = 119 and h = 30, we can calculate that w = 56.</p>\n<p>In fact, for integer values x, y, h and 0 &#x3C; x &#x3C; y &#x3C; 200, there are only five triplets (x,y,h) producing integer solutions for w: (70, 119, 30), (74, 182, 21), (87, 105, 35), (100, 116, 35) and (119, 175, 40).</p>\n<p>For integer values x, y, h and 0 &#x3C; x &#x3C; y &#x3C; 1 000 000, how many triplets (x,y,h) produce integer solutions for w?</p>\n</section>",
