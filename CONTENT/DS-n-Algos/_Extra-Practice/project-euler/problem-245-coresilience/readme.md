# Problem 245: Coresilience

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-245-coresilience)

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the
ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4⁄11.

The resilience of a number d > 1 is then φ(d)d − 1 , where φ is Euler's totient
function. We further define the coresilience of a number n > 1 as C(n)= n −
φ(n)n − 1. The coresilience of a prime p is C(p) = 1p − 1. Find the sum of all
composite integers 1 < n ≤ 2×1011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction.
