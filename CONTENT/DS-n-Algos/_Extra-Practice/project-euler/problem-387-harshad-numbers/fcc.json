Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits, results in a prime a strong Harshad number.</p>\n<p>Now take the number 2011 which is prime. When we truncate the last digit from it we get 201, a strong Harshad number that is also right truncatable. Let's call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.</p>\n<p>You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than 10000 is 90619.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than 1014.</p>\n</section>",
