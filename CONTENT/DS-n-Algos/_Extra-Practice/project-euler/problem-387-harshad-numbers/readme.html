<p>A Harshad or Niven number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.</p>
<p>201 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits.)</p>
<p>When we truncate the last digit from 201, we get 20, which is a Harshad number.</p>
<p>When we truncate the last digit from 20, we get 2, which is also a Harshad number.</p>
<p>Let’s call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last digit, always results in a Harshad number a right truncatable Harshad number.</p>
<p>Also: 201/3=67 which is prime. Let’s call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits, results in a prime a strong Harshad number.</p>
<p>Now take the number 2011 which is prime. When we truncate the last digit from it we get 201, a strong Harshad number that is also right truncatable. Let’s call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.</p>
<p>You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than 10000 is 90619.</p>
<p>Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than 1014.</p>
