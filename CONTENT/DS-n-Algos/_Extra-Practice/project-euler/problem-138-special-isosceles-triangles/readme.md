# Problem 138: Special isosceles triangles

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-138-special-isosceles-triangles)

Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs, L = 17.

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle,
h = √(172 − 82) = 15, which is one less than the base length. With b = 272 and L
= 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the base length, and this is the
second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that h = b ± 1. Find ∑ L
for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h = b ± 1 and b, L are
positive integers.
