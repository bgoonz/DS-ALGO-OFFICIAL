# Problem 6: Sum square difference

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-6-sum-square-difference)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural
numbers and the square of the sum.
