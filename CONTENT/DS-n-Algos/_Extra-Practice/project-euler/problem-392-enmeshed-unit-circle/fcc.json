  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A rectilinear grid is an orthogonal grid where the spacing between the gridlines does not have to be equidistant.</p>\n<p>An example of such grid is logarithmic graph paper.</p>\n<p>Consider rectilinear grids in the Cartesian coordinate system with the following properties:The gridlines are parallel to the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.There are N+2 vertical and N+2 horizontal gridlines. Hence there are (N+1) x (N+1) rectangular cells.The equations of the two outer vertical gridlines are x = -1 and x = 1.The equations of the two outer horizontal gridlines are y = -1 and y = 1.The grid cells are colored red if they overlap with the unit circle, black otherwise.For this problem we would like you to find the positions of the remaining N inner horizontal and N inner vertical gridlines so that the area occupied by the red cells is minimized.</p>\n<p>E.g. here is a picture of the solution for N = 10:</p>\n<p>The area occupied by the red cells for N = 10 rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point is 3.3469640797.</p>\n<p>Find the positions for N = 400. Give as your answer the area occupied by the red cells rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.</p>\n</section>",
