# Problem 264: Triangle Centres

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-264-triangle-centres)

Consider all the triangles having:

All their vertices on lattice points.

Circumcentre at the origin O.

Orthocentre at the point H(5, 0).

There are nine such triangles having a perimeter ≤ 50.

Listed and shown in ascending order of their perimeter, they are:

A(-4, 3), B(5, 0), C(4, -3) A(4, 3), B(5, 0), C(-4, -3) A(-3, 4), B(5, 0), C(3,
-4) A(3, 4), B(5, 0), C(-3, -4) A(0, 5), B(5, 0), C(0, -5) A(1, 8), B(8, -1),
C(-4, -7) A(8, 1), B(1, -8), C(-4, 7) A(2, 9), B(9, -2), C(-6, -7) A(9, 2), B(2,
-9), C(-6, 7)

The sum of their perimeters, rounded to four decimal places, is 291.0089.

Find all such triangles with a perimeter ≤ 105. Enter as your answer the sum of
their perimeters rounded to four decimal places.
