# Problem 168: Number Rotations

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-168-number-rotations)

Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last
digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.

It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857.

This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its
right-rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10100, that have
this property.
