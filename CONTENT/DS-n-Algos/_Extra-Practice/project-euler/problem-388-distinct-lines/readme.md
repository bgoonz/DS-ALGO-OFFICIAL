# Problem 388: Distinct Lines

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-388-distinct-lines)

Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ N.

From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points. Let
D(N) be the number of distinct such lines.

You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.

Find D(1010). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last
nine digits.
