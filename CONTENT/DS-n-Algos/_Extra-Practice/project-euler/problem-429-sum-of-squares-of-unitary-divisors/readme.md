# Problem 429: Sum of squares of unitary divisors

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-429-sum-of-squares-of-unitary-divisors)

A unitary divisor d of a number n is a divisor of n that has the property gcd(d,
n/d) = 1.

The unitary divisors of 4! = 24 are 1, 3, 8 and 24.

The sum of their squares is 12 + 32 + 82 + 242 = 650.

Let S(n) represent the sum of the squares of the unitary divisors of n. Thus
S(4!)=650.

Find S(100 000 000!) modulo 1 000 000 009.
