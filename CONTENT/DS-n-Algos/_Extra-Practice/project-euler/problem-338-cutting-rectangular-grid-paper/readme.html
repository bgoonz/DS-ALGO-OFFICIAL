<p>A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions w × h is given. Its grid spacing is 1.</p>
<p>When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.</p>
<p>For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 4 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 × 2, 12 × 3 and 6 × 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:</p>
<p>Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 8 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 × 4 and 12 × 6 .</p>
<p>For a pair w and h, let F(w,h) be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions w × h . For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2. Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in F(w,h). Note also that rectangles with dimensions w × h and dimensions h × w are not considered distinct.</p>
<p>For an integer N, let G(N) be the sum of F(w,h) for all pairs w and h which satisfy 0 &lt; h ≤ w ≤ N. We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(103) = 971745 and G(105) = 9992617687.</p>
<p>Find G(1012). Give your answer modulo 108.</p>
