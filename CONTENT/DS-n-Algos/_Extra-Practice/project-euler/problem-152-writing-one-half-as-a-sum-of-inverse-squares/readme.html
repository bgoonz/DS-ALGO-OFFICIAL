<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-152-writing-one-half-as-a-sum-of-inverse-squares">FCC link</a></p>
<p>There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers.</p>
<p>For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:</p>
<p>In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}. How many ways are there to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive?</p>
