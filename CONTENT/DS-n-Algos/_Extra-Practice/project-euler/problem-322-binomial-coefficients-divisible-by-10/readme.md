[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-322-binomial-coefficients-divisible-by-10)

Let T(m, n) be the number of the binomial coefficients iCn that are divisible by
10 for n â‰¤ i < m(i, m and n are positive integers).

You are given that T(109, 107-10) = 989697000.

Find T(1018, 1012-10).
