# Problem 42: Coded triangle numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-42-coded-triangle-numbers)

The `n`th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, `tn` =
Â½`n`(`n`+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example,
the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = `t`10. If the word value is a
triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words array of `n`\-length, how many are triangle words?
