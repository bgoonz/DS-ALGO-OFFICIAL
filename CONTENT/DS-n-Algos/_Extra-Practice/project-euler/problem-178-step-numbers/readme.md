[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-178-step-numbers)

Consider the number 45656.

It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a difference of
one.

A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is
called a step number.

A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.

How many pandigital step numbers less than 1040 are there?
