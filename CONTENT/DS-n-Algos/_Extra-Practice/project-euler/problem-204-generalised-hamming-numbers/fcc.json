  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger than 5.</p>\n<p>So the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.</p>\n<p>There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 108.</p>\n<p>We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type n, if it has no prime factor larger than n. Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.</p>\n<p>How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which don't exceed 109?</p>\n</section>",
