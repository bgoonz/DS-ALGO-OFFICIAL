  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.</p>\n<p>She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the dishes.</p>\n<p>For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>The game starts with S = 0.</p>\n<p>The first player, Louise, adds to S different random numbers from the generator until S > 1 and records her last random number 'x'.</p>\n<p>The second player, Julie, continues adding to S different random numbers from the generator until S > 2 and records her last random number 'y'.</p>\n<p>The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes, i.e. if y > x the second player wins.</p>\n<p>For example, if the first player draws 0.62 and 0.44, the first player turn ends since 0.62+0.44 > 1 and x = 0.44. If the second players draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn ends since 0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91 > 2 and y = 0.91. Since y > x, the second player wins.</p>\n<p>Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: \"That's not fair\". What is the probability that the second player wins? Give your answer rounded to 10 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghij</p>\n</section>",
