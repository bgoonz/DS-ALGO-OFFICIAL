<p>Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.</p>
<p>She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the dishes.</p>
<p>For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The game starts with S = 0.</p>
<p>The first player, Louise, adds to S different random numbers from the generator until S &gt; 1 and records her last random number ‘x’.</p>
<p>The second player, Julie, continues adding to S different random numbers from the generator until S &gt; 2 and records her last random number ‘y’.</p>
<p>The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes, i.e. if y &gt; x the second player wins.</p>
<p>For example, if the first player draws 0.62 and 0.44, the first player turn ends since 0.62+0.44 &gt; 1 and x = 0.44. If the second players draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn ends since 0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91 &gt; 2 and y = 0.91. Since y &gt; x, the second player wins.</p>
<p>Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: “That’s not fair”. What is the probability that the second player wins? Give your answer rounded to 10 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghij</p>
