# Problem 223: Almost right-angled triangles I

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-223-almost-right-angled-triangles-i)

Let us call an integer sided triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c barely acute if the
sides satisfy a2 + b2 = c2 + 1.

How many barely acute triangles are there with perimeter ≤ 25,000,000?
