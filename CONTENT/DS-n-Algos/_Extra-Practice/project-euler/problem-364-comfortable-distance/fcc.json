N people come after each other to fill the seats according to the following rules:</p>\n<p>If there is any seat whose adjacent seat(s) are not occupied take such a seat.</p>\n<p>If there is no such seat and there is any seat for which only one adjacent seat is occupied take such a seat.</p>\n<p>Otherwise take one of the remaining available seats.</p>\n<p>Let T(N) be the number of possibilities that N seats are occupied by N people with the given rules.
