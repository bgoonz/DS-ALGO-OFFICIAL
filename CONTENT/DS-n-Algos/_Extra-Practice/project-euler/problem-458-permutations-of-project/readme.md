[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-458-permutations-of-project)

Consider the alphabet A made out of the letters of the word "project":
A={c,e,j,o,p,r,t}.

Let T(n) be the number of strings of length n consisting of letters from A that
do not have a substring that is one of the 5040 permutations of "project".

T(7)=77-7!=818503.

Find T(1012). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.
