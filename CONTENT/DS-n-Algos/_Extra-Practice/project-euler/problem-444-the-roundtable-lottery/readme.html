<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-444-the-roundtable-lottery">FCC link</a></p>
<p>A group of p people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £p, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for each person to maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.</p>
<p>An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.</li>
<li>The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player’s scratched ticket, and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches his newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.</li>
</ol>
<p>The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.</p>
<p>Assume that each player uses the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of his ticket winnings.</p>
<p>Let E(p) represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of p players (e.g. E(111) = 5.2912 when rounded to 5 significant digits).</p>
<p>Let S1(N) = E(p) Let Sk(N) = Sk-1(p) for k &gt; 1</p>
<p>Find S20(1014) and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent (e.g. S3(100) = 5.983679014e5).</p>
