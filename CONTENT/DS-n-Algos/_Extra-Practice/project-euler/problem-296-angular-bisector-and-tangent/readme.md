# Problem 296: Angular Bisector and Tangent

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-296-angular-bisector-and-tangent)

Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with BC ≤ AC ≤ AB.k is the angular
bisector of angle ACB.m is the tangent at C to the circumscribed circle of ABC.n
is a line parallel to m through B.

The intersection of n and k is called E.

How many triangles ABC with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such that BE
has integral length?
