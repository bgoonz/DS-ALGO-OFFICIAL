<h1 id="problem-399-squarefree-fibonacci-numbers">Problem 399: Squarefree Fibonacci Numbers</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-399-squarefree-fibonacci-numbers">FCC link</a></p>
<p>The first 15 fibonacci numbers are:</p>
<p>1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.</p>
<p>It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4 and 144 is divisible by 4 and by 9.</p>
<p>So the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:</p>
<p>1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377 and 610.</p>
<p>The 200th squarefree fibonacci number is: 971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445. The last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in scientific notation this number can be written as 9.7e53.</p>
<p>Find the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number. Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the decimal point). For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been: 1608739584170445,9.7e53</p>
<p>Note: For this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci number divisible by p is not divisible by p2 (this is part of Wall’s conjecture). This has been verified for primes ≤ 3·1015, but has not been proven in general.</p>
<p>If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to this problem isn’t guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for that number.</p>
