  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.</p>\n<p>E.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.</p>\n<p>The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.</p>\n<p>A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.</p>\n<p>A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.</p>\n<p>Define S(N) as the sum of (xi+yi) for all losing configurations (xi,yi), 0 &#x3C; xi &#x3C; yi â‰¤ N. We can verify that S(10) = 211 and S(104) = 230312207313.</p>\n<p>Find S(1016) mod 710.</p>\n</section>",
