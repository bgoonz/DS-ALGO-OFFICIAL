[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-41-pandigital-prime)

We shall say that an `n`\-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
digits 1 to `n` exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is
also prime.

What is the largest `n`\-length digit pandigital prime that exists?
