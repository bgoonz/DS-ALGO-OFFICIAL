The decimal expansion of such square roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.</p>\n<p>The square root of two is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital sum of the first one hundred decimal digits is 475.</p>\n<p>For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of the digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational square roots.</p>\n</section>",
