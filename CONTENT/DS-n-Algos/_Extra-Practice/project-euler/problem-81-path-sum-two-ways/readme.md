# Problem 81: Path sum: two ways

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-81-path-sum-two-ways)

In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom
right, by **only moving to the right and down**, is indicated in bold red and is
equal to 2427.

$\\begin{pmatrix} \\color{red}{131} & 673 & 234 & 103 & 18\\\\\\\\ \\color{red}{201} & \\color{red}{96} & \\color{red}{342} & 965 & 150\\\\\\\\ 630 & 803 & \\color{red}{746} & \\color{red}{422} & 111\\\\\\\\ 537 & 699 & 497 & \\color{red}{121} & 956\\\\\\\\ 805 & 732 & 524 & \\color{red}{37} & \\color{red}{331} \\end{pmatrix}$

Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by only moving
right and down in `matrix`, a 2D array containing an 80 by 80 matrix.
