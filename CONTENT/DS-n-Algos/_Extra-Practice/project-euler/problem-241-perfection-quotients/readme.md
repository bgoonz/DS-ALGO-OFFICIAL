# Problem 241: Perfection Quotients

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-241-perfection-quotients)

For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. σ(6)
= 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.

A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with σ(n) = 2n.

Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer asp(n)= σ(n)n . Find
the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 1018 for which p(n) has the form k + 1⁄2,
where k is an integer.
