# Problem 171: Finding numbers for which the sum of the squares of the digits is a square

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-171-finding-numbers-for-which-the-sum-of-the-squares-of-the-digits-is-a-square)

For a positive integer n, let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits (in
base 10) of n, e.g.

f(3) = 32 = 9,

f(25) = 22 + 52 = 4 + 25 = 29,

f(442) = 42 + 42 + 22 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36

Find the last nine digits of the sum of all n, 0 < n < 1020, such that f(n) is a
perfect square.
