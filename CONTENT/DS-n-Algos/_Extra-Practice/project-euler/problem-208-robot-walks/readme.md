# Problem 208: Robot Walks

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-208-robot-walks)

A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72Â°), with a free choice
of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no turning on the
spot.

One of 70932 possible closed paths of 25 arcs starting northward is

Given that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs in length
can it take that return it, after the final arc, to its starting position? (Any
arc may be traversed multiple times.)
