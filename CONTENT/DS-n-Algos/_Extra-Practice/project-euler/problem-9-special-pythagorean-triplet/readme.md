# Problem 9: Special Pythagorean triplet

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-9-special-pythagorean-triplet)

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, `a` < `b` < `c`, for
which,

a2 + b2 = c2

For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a` + `b` + `c` = 1000.
Find the product `abc` such that `a` + `b` + `c` = `n`.
