  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value a1 in the following way:</p>\n<p>an+1 = an/3 if an is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large downward step, \"D\".</p>\n<p>an+1 = (4an + 2)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We shall denote this as an upward step, \"U\".</p>\n<p>an+1 = (2an - 1)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We shall denote this as a small downward step, \"d\".</p>\n<p>The sequence terminates when some an = 1.</p>\n<p>Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps. For instance if a1=231, then the sequence {an}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps \"DdDddUUdDD\".</p>\n<p>Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence \"DdDddUUdDD....\". For instance, if a1=1004064, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD. In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a1 > 106 that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.</p>\n<p>What is the smallest a1 > 1015 that begins with the sequence \"UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd\"?</p>\n</section>",
