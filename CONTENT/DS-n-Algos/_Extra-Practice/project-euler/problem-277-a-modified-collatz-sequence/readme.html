<p>A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value a1 in the following way:</p>
<p>an+1 = an/3 if an is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large downward step, “D”.</p>
<p>an+1 = (4an + 2)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We shall denote this as an upward step, “U”.</p>
<p>an+1 = (2an - 1)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We shall denote this as a small downward step, “d”.</p>
<p>The sequence terminates when some an = 1.</p>
<p>Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps. For instance if a1=231, then the sequence {an}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps “DdDddUUdDD”.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence “DdDddUUdDD….”. For instance, if a1=1004064, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD. In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a1 &gt; 106 that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.</p>
<p>What is the smallest a1 &gt; 1015 that begins with the sequence “UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd”?</p>
