# Problem 176: Right-angled triangles that share a cathetus

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-176-right-angled-triangles-that-share-a-cathetus)

The four right-angled triangles with sides (9,12,15), (12,16,20), (5,12,13) and
(12,35,37) all have one of the shorter sides (catheti) equal to 12. It can be
shown that no other integer sided right-angled triangle exists with one of the
catheti equal to 12.

Find the smallest integer that can be the length of a cathetus of exactly 47547
different integer sided right-angled triangles.
