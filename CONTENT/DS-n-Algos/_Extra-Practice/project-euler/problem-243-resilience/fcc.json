  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.</p>\n<p>For any denominator, d, there will be dâˆ’1 proper fractions; for example, with d = 12:1/12 , 2/12 , 3/12 , 4/12 , 5/12 , 6/12 , 7/12 , 8/12 , 9/12 , 10/12 , 11/12 .</p>\n<p>We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4/11 . In fact, d = 12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience R(d) &#x3C; 4/10 .</p>\n<p>Find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience R(d) &#x3C; 15499/94744 .</p>\n</section>",
