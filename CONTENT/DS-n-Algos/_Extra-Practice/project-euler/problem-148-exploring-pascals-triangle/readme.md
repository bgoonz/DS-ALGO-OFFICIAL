# Problem 148: Exploring Pascal's triangle

We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of
Pascal's triangle are divisible by 7:

            1
          1   1
        1   2   1
      1   3   3   1
    1   4   6   4   1

1 5 10 10 5 1 1 6 15 20 15 6 1

However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of
the 5050 entries are not divisible by 7.
