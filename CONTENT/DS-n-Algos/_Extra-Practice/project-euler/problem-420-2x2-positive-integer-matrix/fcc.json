Here is an example:</p>\n<p>We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.</p>\n<p>Find F(107).</p>\n</section>",
