# Problem 420: 2x2 positive integer matrix

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-420-2x2-positive-integer-matrix)

A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.

Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive
integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:

We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a
trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer
matrix in two different ways. We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.

Find F(107).
