# Problem 30: Digit n powers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-30-digit-n-powers)

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44

8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84

9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44

As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of `n` powers of
their digits.
