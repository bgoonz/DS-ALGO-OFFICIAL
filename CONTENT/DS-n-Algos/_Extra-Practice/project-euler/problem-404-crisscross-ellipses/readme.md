# Problem 404: Crisscross Ellipses

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-404-crisscross-ellipses)

Ea is an ellipse with an equation of the form x2 + 4y2 = 4a2.

Ea' is the rotated image of Ea by θ degrees counterclockwise around the origin
O(0, 0) for 0° < θ < 90°.

b is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to the
origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection points. We call an
ordered triplet (a, b, c) a canonical ellipsoidal triplet if a, b and c are
positive integers. For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal
triplet.

Let C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b, c) for
a ≤ N. It can be verified that C(103) = 7, C(104) = 106 and C(106) = 11845.

Find C(1017).
