  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A sequence of integers S = {si} is called an n-sequence if it has n elements and each element si satisfies 1 ≤ si ≤ n. Thus there are nn distinct n-sequences in total.</p>\n<p>For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.</p>\n<p>For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of S with the same value. For example, for the given sequence S above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.</p>\n<p>Let f(n) = ∑ L(S) for all n-sequences S.</p>\n<p>For example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.</p>\n<p>Find f(7 500 000) mod 1 000 000 009.</p>\n</section>",
