# Problem 346: Strong Repunits

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-346-strong-repunits)

The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11 written in
base 6 (i.e. 710 = 116 = 1112). In other words, 7 is a repunit in at least two
bases b > 1.

We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be
verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50: {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}.
Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.

Find the sum of all strong repunits below 1012.
