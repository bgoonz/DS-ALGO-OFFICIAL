# Problem 91: Right triangles with integer coordinates

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-91-right-triangles-with-integer-coordinates)

The points P (`x`1, `y`1) and Q (`x`2, `y`2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates
and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed
when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is, 0 ≤ `x`1, `y`1,
`x`2, `y`2 ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ `x`1, `y`1, `x`2, `y`2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be
formed?
