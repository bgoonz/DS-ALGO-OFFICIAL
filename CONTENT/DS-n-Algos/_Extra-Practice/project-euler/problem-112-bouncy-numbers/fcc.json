  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p>\n<p>Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.</p>\n<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, 155349.</p>\n<p>Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.</p>\n<p>Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%.</p>\n</section>",
