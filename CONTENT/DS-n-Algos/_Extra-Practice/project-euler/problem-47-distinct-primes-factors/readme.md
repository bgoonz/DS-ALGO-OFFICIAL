[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-47-distinct-primes-factors)

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7

15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 22 × 7 × 23

645 = 3 × 5 × 43

646 = 2 × 17 × 19

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors
each. What is the first of these numbers?
