  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.</p>\n<p>Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways. For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways: 22852 + 203 22232 + 663 18102 + 1253 11972 + 1563</p>\n<p>Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.</p>\n</section>",
