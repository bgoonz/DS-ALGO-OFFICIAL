# Problem 348: Sum of a square and a cube

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-348-sum-of-a-square-and-a-cube)

Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in
more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square
and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways. For example,
5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different
ways: 22852 + 203 22232 + 663 18102 + 1253 11972 + 1563

Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
