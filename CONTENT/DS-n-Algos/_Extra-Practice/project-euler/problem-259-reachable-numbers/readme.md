# Problem 259: Reachable Numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-259-reachable-numbers)

A positive integer will be called reachable if it can result from an arithmetic
expression obeying the following rules:

Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each. Any successive
digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits 2, 3 and 4 we obtain
the number 234). Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed. Each operation can be
used any number of times, or not at all. Unary minus is not allowed. Any number
of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the order of operations.
For example, 42 is reachable, since (1/23) \_((4_5)-6) \* (78-9) = 42.

What is the sum of all positive reachable integers?
