# Problem 83: Path sum: four ways

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-83-path-sum-four-ways)

**Note:** This problem is a significantly more challenging version of
Problem 81.

In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom
right, by moving left, right, up, and down, is indicated in bold red and is
equal to 2297.

$\\begin{pmatrix} \\color{red}{131} & 673 & \\color{red}{234} & \\color{red}{103} & \\color{red}{18}\\\\\\\\ \\color{red}{201} & \\color{red}{96} & \\color{red}{342} & 965 & \\color{red}{150}\\\\\\\\ 630 & 803 & 746 & \\color{red}{422} & \\color{red}{111}\\\\\\\\ 537 & 699 & 497 & \\color{red}{121} & 956\\\\\\\\ 805 & 732 & 524 & \\color{red}{37} & \\color{red}{331} \\end{pmatrix}$

Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by moving left,
right, up, and down in `matrix`, a 2D array defined in the background,
containing an 80 by 80 matrix.
