  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>For any triangle T in the plane, it can be shown that there is a unique ellipse with largest area that is completely inside T.</p>\n<p>For a given n, consider triangles T such that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the vertices of T have integer coordinates with absolute value ≤ n, and</li>\n<li>the foci1 of the largest-area ellipse inside T are (√13,0) and (-√13,0).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let A(n) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.</p>\n<p>For example, if n = 8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are (-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0) and (4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0), and the area of each triangle is 36. Thus A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72.</p>\n<p>It can be verified that A(10) = 252, A(100) = 34632 and A(1000) = 3529008.</p>\n<p>Find A(1 000 000 000).</p>\n<p>1The foci (plural of focus) of an ellipse are two points A and B such that for every point P on the boundary of the ellipse, AP + PB is constant.</p>\n</section>",
