# Problem 181: Investigating in how many ways objects of two different colours can be grouped

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-181-investigating-in-how-many-ways-objects-of-two-different-colours-can-be-grouped)

Having three black objects B and one white object W they can be grouped in 7
ways like this:

(BBBW)(B,BBW)(B,B,BW)(B,B,B,W)

(B,BB,W)(BBB,W)(BB,BW)

In how many ways can sixty black objects B and forty white objects W be thus
grouped?
