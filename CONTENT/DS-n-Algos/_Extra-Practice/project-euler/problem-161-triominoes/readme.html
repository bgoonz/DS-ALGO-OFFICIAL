<p>A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.</p>
<p>There are two basic forms:</p>
<p>If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:</p>
<p>Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes. If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be tiled with triominoes:</p>
<p>In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?</p>
