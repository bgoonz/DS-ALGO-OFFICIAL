[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-161-triominoes)

A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.

There are two basic forms:

If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:

Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes. If
we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another
tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be tiled with
triominoes:

In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?
