# Problem 435: Polynomials of Fibonacci numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-435-polynomials-of-fibonacci-numbers)

The Fibonacci numbers {fn, n ≥ 0} are defined recursively as fn = fn-1 + fn-2
with base cases f0 = 0 and f1 = 1.

Define the polynomials {Fn, n ≥ 0} as Fn(x) = ∑fixi for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

For example, F7(x) = x + x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 + 5x5 + 8x6 + 13x7, and F7(11)
= 268357683.

Let n = 1015. Find the sum \[∑0≤x≤100 Fn(x)\] mod 1307674368000 (= 15!).
