  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P<sub>n</sub>=<code>n</code>(3<code>n</code>−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:</p>\n<p>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...</p>\n<p>It can be seen that P<sub>4</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> = 22 + 70 = 92 = P<sub>8</sub>. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.</p>\n<p>Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P<sub>j</sub> and P<sub>k</sub>, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P<sub>k</sub> − P<sub>j</sub>| is minimized; what is the value of D?</p>\n</section>",
