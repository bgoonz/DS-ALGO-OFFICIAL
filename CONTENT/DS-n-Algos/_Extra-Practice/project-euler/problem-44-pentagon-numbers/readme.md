# Problem 44: Pentagon numbers

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-44-pentagon-numbers)

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn\=`n`(3`n`−1)/2. The first
ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 −
22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and
difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimized; what is the value of
D?
