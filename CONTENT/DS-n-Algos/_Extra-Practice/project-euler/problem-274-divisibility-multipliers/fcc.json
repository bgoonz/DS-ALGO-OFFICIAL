  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>For each integer p > 1 coprime to 10 there is a positive divisibility multiplier m &#x3C; p which preserves divisibility by p for the following function on any positive integer, n:</p>\n<p>f(n) = (all but the last digit of n) + (the last digit of n) * m</p>\n<p>That is, if m is the divisibility multiplier for p, then f(n) is divisible by p if and only if n is divisible by p.</p>\n<p>(When n is much larger than p, f(n) will be less than n and repeated application of f provides a multiplicative divisibility test for p.)</p>\n<p>For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.</p>\n<p>f(76275) = 7627 + 5 <em>34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797 are both divisible by 113f(12345) = 1234 + 5</em> 34 = 1404 : 12345 and 1404 are both not divisible by 113</p>\n<p>The sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to 10 and less than 1000 is 39517.
