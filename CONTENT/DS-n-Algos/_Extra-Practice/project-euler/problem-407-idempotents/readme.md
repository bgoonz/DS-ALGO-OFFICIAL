# Problem 407: Idempotents

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-407-idempotents)

If we calculate a2 mod 6 for 0 ≤ a ≤ 5 we get: 0,1,4,3,4,1.

The largest value of a such that a2 ≡ a mod 6 is 4. Let's call M(n) the largest
value of a < n such that a2 ≡ a (mod n). So M(6) = 4.

Find ∑M(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 107.
