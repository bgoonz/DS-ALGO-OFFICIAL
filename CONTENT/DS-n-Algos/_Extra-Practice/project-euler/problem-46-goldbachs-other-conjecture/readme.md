# Problem 46: Goldbach's other conjecture

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-46-goldbachs-other-conjecture)

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be
written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×12

15 = 7 + 2×22

21 = 3 + 2×32

25 = 7 + 2×32

27 = 19 + 2×22

33 = 31 + 2×12

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime
and twice a square?
