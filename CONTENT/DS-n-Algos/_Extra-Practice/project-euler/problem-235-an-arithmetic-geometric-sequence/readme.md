[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-235-an-arithmetic-geometric-sequence)

Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(k) = (900-3k)rk-1.

Let s(n) = Î£k=1...nu(k).

Find the value of r for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000.

Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.
