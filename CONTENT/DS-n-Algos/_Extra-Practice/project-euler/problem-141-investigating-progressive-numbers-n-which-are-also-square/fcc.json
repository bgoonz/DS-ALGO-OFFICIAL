  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A positive integer, n, is divided by d and the quotient and remainder are q and r respectively. In addition d, q, and r are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.</p>\n<p>For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can also be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio 3/2).</p>\n<p>We will call such numbers, n, progressive.</p>\n<p>Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 1022, happen to also be perfect squares. The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is 124657.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion (1012).</p>\n</section>",
