Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red
tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three units, and blue tiles
measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five units in
length in exactly fifteen different ways.

How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled? NOTE: This is
