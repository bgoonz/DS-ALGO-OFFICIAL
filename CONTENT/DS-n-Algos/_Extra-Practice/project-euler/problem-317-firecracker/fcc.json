  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.</p>\n<p>We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s2.</p>\n<p>Find the volume (in m3) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.</p>\n</section>",
