  "title": "Problem 380: Amazing Mazes!",
  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>An m×n maze is an m×n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other square. The following are examples of a 9×12 maze and a 15×20 maze:</p>\n<p>Let C(m,n) be the number of distinct m×n mazes. Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered distinct.</p>\n<p>It can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits). Find C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits.</p>\n<p>When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. E.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.</p>\n</section>",
