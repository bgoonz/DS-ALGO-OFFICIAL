# Problem 35: Circular primes

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-35-circular-primes)

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits:
197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71,
73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below `n`, whereas 100 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000000?

**Note:**

Circular primes individual rotation can exceed `n`.
