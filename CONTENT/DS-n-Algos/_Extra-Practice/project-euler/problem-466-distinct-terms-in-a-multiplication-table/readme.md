# Problem 466: Distinct terms in a multiplication table

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-466-distinct-terms-in-a-multiplication-table)

Let P(m,n) be the number of distinct terms in an m×n multiplication table.

For example, a 3×4 multiplication table looks like this:

× 12341 12342 24683 36912

There are 8 distinct terms {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12}, therefore P(3,4) = 8.

You are given that: P(64,64) = 1263, P(12,345) = 1998, and P(32,1015)
= 13826382602124302.

Find P(64,1016).
