<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-175-fractions-involving-the-number-of-different-ways-a-number-can-be-expressed-as-a-sum-of-powers-of-2">FCC link</a></p>
<p>Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of ways to write n as a sum of powers of 2 where no power occurs more than twice.</p>
<p>For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:10 = 8+2 = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1</p>
<p>It can be shown that for every fraction p/q (p&gt;0, q&gt;0) there exists at least one integer n such that f(n)/f(n-1)=p/q. For instance, the smallest n for which f(n)/f(n-1)=13/17 is 241. The binary expansion of 241 is 11110001. Reading this binary number from the most significant bit to the least significant bit there are 4 oneâ€™s, 3 zeroes and 1 one. We shall call the string 4,3,1 the Shortened Binary Expansion of 241. Find the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest n for which f(n)/f(n-1)=123456789/987654321. Give your answer as comma separated integers, without any whitespaces.</p>
