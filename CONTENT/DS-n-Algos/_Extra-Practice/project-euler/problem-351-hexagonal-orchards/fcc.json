  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A hexagonal orchard of order n is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side n. The following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:</p>\n<p>Highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.</p>\n<p>Let H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order n.</p>\n<p>H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.</p>\n<p>Find H(100 000 000).</p>\n</section>",
