# Problem 324: Building a tower

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-324-building-a-tower)

Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3×3×n tower with blocks of
2×1×1. You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however,
rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.

For example (with q = 100000007) :f(2) = 229,f(4) = 117805,f(10) mod q =
96149360,f(103) mod q = 24806056,f(106) mod q = 30808124.

Find f(1010000) mod 100000007.
