# Problem 341: Golomb's self-describing sequence

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-341-golombs-self-describing-sequence)

The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence
of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The
values of G(n) for the first few n are

n123456789101112131415…G(n)122334445556666…

You are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137. You are also given that ΣG(n3) =
153506976 for 1 ≤ n < 103.

Find ΣG(n3) for 1 ≤ n < 106.
