# Problem 269: Polynomials with at least one integer root

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-269-polynomials-with-at-least-one-integer-root)

A root or zero of a polynomial P(x) is a solution to the equation P(x) = 0.

Define Pn as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of n.

For example, P5703(x) = 5x3 + 7x2 + 3.

We can see that:Pn(0) is the last digit of n, Pn(1) is the sum of the digits of
n, Pn(10) is n itself.Define Z(k) as the number of positive integers, n, not
exceeding k for which the polynomial Pn has at least one integer root.

It can be verified that Z(100 000) is 14696.

What is Z(1016)?
