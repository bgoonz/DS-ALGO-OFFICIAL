  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b and N integer.</p>\n<p>For N=65 there are two solutions: a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7. We call S(N) the sum of the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b and N integer. Thus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5. Find ∑S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 with 4k+1 &#x3C; 150.</p>\n</section>",
