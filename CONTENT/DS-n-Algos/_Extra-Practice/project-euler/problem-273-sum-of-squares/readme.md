# Problem 273: Sum of Squares

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-273-sum-of-squares)

Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b and N integer.

For N=65 there are two solutions: a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7. We call S(N) the sum of
the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b and N integer.
Thus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5. Find ∑S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by
primes of the form 4k+1 with 4k+1 < 150.
