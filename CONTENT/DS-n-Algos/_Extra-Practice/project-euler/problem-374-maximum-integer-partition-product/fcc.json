  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.</p>\n<p>Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same. A partition of n into distinct parts is a partition of n in which every part occurs at most once.</p>\n<p>The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are: 5, 4+1 and 3+2.</p>\n<p>Let f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n into distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such partition of n with that product.</p>\n<p>So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.</p>\n<p>For n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f(10)=30 and m(10)=3. And their product, f(10)·m(10) = 30·3 = 90</p>\n<p>It can be verified that ∑f(n)·m(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 = 1683550844462.</p>\n<p>Find ∑f(n)·m(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1014. Give your answer modulo 982451653, the 50 millionth prime.</p>\n</section>",
