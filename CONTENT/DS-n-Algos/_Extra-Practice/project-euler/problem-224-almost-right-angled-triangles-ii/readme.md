# Problem 224: Almost right-angled triangles II

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-224-almost-right-angled-triangles-ii)

Let us call an integer sided triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c barely obtuse if the
sides satisfy a2 + b2 = c2 - 1.

How many barely obtuse triangles are there with perimeter ≤ 75,000,000?
