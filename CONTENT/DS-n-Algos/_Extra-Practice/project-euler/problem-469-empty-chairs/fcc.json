  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In a room N chairs are placed around a round table.</p>\n<p>Knights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available empty chair.</p>\n<p>To have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty chair between each other.</p>\n<p>When there aren't any suitable chairs left, the fraction C of empty chairs is determined. We also define E(N) as the expected value of C. We can verify that E(4) = 1/2 and E(6) = 5/9.</p>\n<p>Find E(1018). Give your answer rounded to fourteen decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghijklmn.</p>\n</section>",
