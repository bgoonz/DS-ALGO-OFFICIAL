  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The quadtree encoding allows us to describe a 2N×2N black and white image as a sequence of bits (0 and 1). Those sequences are to be read from left to right like this:</p>\n<p>the first bit deals with the complete 2N×2N region;</p>\n<p>\"0\" denotes a split:</p>\n<p>the current 2n×2n region is divided into 4 sub-regions of dimension 2n-1×2n-1,</p>\n<p>the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;</p>\n<p>\"10\" indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;</p>\n<p>\"11\" indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.Consider the following 4×4 image (colored marks denote places where a split can occur):</p>\n<p>This image can be described by several sequences, for example : \"001010101001011111011010101010\", of length 30, or \"0100101111101110\", of length 16, which is the minimal sequence for this image.</p>\n<p>For a positive integer N, define DN as the 2N×2N image with the following coloring scheme: the pixel with coordinates x = 0, y = 0 corresponds to the bottom left pixel, if (x - 2N-1)2 + (y - 2N-1)2 ≤ 22N-2 then the pixel is black, otherwise the pixel is white.What is the length of the minimal sequence describing D24 ?</p>\n</section>",
