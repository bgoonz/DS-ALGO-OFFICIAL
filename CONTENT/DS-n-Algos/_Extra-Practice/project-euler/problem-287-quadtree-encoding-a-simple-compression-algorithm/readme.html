<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-287-quadtree-encoding-a-simple-compression-algorithm">FCC link</a></p>
<p>The quadtree encoding allows us to describe a 2N×2N black and white image as a sequence of bits (0 and 1). Those sequences are to be read from left to right like this:</p>
<p>the first bit deals with the complete 2N×2N region;</p>
<p>“0” denotes a split:</p>
<p>the current 2n×2n region is divided into 4 sub-regions of dimension 2n-1×2n-1,</p>
<p>the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;</p>
<p>“10” indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;</p>
<p>“11” indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.Consider the following 4×4 image (colored marks denote places where a split can occur):</p>
<p>This image can be described by several sequences, for example : “001010101001011111011010101010”, of length 30, or “0100101111101110”, of length 16, which is the minimal sequence for this image.</p>
<p>For a positive integer N, define DN as the 2N×2N image with the following coloring scheme: the pixel with coordinates x = 0, y = 0 corresponds to the bottom left pixel, if (x - 2N-1)2 + (y - 2N-1)2 ≤ 22N-2 then the pixel is black, otherwise the pixel is white.What is the length of the minimal sequence describing D24 ?</p>
