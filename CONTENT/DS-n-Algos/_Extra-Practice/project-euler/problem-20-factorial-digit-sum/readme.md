# Problem 20: Factorial digit sum

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-20-factorial-digit-sum)

`n`! means `n` × (`n` − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,

and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits `n`!
