We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.</p>\n<p>Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n, and let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.</p>\n<p>You are given that for all primes, p > 5, that p − 1 is divisible by A(p). For example, when p = 41, A(41) = 5, and 40 is divisible by 5.</p>\n<p>However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true; the first five examples being 91, 259, 451, 481, and 703.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of n for whichGCD(n, 10) = 1 and n − 1 is divisible by A(n).</p>\n</section>",
