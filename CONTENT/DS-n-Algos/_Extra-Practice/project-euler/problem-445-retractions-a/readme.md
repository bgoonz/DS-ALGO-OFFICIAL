[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-445-retractions-a)

For every integer n>1, the family of functions fn,a,b is defined

by fn,a,b(x)≡ax+b mod n for a,b,x integer and 0

You are given that ∑ R(c) for c=C(100 000,k), and 1 ≤ k ≤99 999 ≡628701600 (mod
1 000 000 007). (C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient).

Find ∑ R(c) for c=C(10 000 000,k), and 1 ≤k≤ 9 999 999. Give your answer modulo
1 000 000 007.
