<p>As we all know the equation x2=-1 has no solutions for real x.</p>
<p>If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two solutions: x=i and x=-i.</p>
<p>If we go a step further the equation (x-3)2=-4 has two complex solutions: x=3+2i and x=3-2i. x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others’ complex conjugate.</p>
<p>Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.</p>
<p>In general a+bi and a−bi are each other’s complex conjugate. A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are integers.</p>
<p>The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).</p>
<p>To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b ≠ 0 we call such integers “rational integers.”</p>
<p>A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result is also a Gaussian integer.</p>
<p>If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify in the following manner:</p>
<p>Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1−2i.</p>
<p>The result is .</p>
<p>So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.</p>
<p>Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because .</p>
<p>Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n. In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2i, 1 − 2i, 2 + i, 2 − i, 5}.</p>
<p>The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:</p>
