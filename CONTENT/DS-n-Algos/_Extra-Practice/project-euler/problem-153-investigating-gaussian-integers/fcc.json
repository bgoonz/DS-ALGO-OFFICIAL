A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are integers.</p>\n<p>The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).</p>\n<p>To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b ≠ 0 we call such integers \"rational integers.\"</p>\n<p>A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result is also a Gaussian integer.</p>\n<p>If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify in the following manner:</p>\n<p>Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1−2i.</p>\n<p>The result is .</p>\n<p>So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.</p>\n<p>Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because .</p>\n<p>Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n.
