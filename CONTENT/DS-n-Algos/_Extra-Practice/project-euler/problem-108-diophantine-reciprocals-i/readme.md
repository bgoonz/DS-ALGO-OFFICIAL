# Problem 108: Diophantine Reciprocals I

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-108-diophantine-reciprocals-i)

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1/`x` + 1/`y` = 1/`n`

For `n` = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

1/5 + 1/20 = 1/4

1/6 + 1/12 = 1/4

1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4

What is the least value of `n` for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds one-thousand?
