# Problem 190: Maximising a weighted product

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-190-maximising-a-weighted-product)

Let Sm = (x1, x2, ... , xm) be the m-tuple of positive real numbers with x1 +
x2 + ... + xm = m for which Pm = x1 \* x22 \* ... \* xmm is maximised.

For example, it can be verified that \[P10\] = 4112 (\[ \] is the integer part
function).

Find Σ\[Pm\] for 2 ≤ m ≤ 15.
