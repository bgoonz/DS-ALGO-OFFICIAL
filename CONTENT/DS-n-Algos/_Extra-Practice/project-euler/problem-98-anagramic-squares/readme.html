<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-98-anagramic-squares">FCC link</a></p>
<p>By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 362. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 962. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.</p>
<p>Using the included array, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).</p>
<p>What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All anagrams formed must be contained in the given <code>words</code> array.</p>
