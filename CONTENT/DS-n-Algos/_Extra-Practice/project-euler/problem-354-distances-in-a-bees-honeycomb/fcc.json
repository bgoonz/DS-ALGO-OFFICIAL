  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.</p>\n<p>One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee. For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. For example, B(√3) = 6, B(√21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.</p>\n<p>Find the number of L ≤ 5·1011 such that B(L) = 450.</p>\n</section>",
