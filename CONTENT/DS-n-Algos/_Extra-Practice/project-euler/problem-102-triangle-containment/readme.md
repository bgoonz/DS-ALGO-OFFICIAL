# Problem 102: Triangle containment

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-102-triangle-containment)

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which
-1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)

X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ
does not.

Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file
containing the coordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number
of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example
given above.
