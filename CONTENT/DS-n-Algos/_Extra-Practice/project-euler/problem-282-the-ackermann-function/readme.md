[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-282-the-ackermann-function)

For non-negative integers m, n, the Ackermann function A(m, n) is defined as
follows:

For example A(1, 0) = 2, A(2, 2) = 7 and A(3, 4) = 125.

Find A(n, n) and give your answer mod 148.
