<h1 id="problem-465-polar-polygons">Problem 465: Polar polygons</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-465-polar-polygons">FCC link</a></p>
<p>The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire polygonâ€™s boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.</p>
<p>For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.</p>
<p>For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):</p>
<p>Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.</p>
<p>Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x, y) have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.</p>
<p>Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].</p>
<p>For example, P(1) = 131, P(2) = 1648531, P(3) = 1099461296175 and P(343) mod 1 000 000 007 = 937293740.</p>
<p>Find P(713) mod 1 000 000 007.</p>
