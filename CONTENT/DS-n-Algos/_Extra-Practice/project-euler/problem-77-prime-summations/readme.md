# Problem 77: Prime summations

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-77-prime-summations)

It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

7 + 3

5 + 5

5 + 3 + 2

3 + 3 + 2 + 2

2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five
thousand different ways?
