# Problem 233: Lattice points on a circle

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-233-lattice-points-on-a-circle)

Let f(N) be the number of points with integer coordinates that are on a circle
passing through (0,0), (N,0),(0,N), and (N,N).

It can be shown that f(10000) = 36.

What is the sum of all positive integers N â‰¤ 1011 such that f(N) = 420 ?
