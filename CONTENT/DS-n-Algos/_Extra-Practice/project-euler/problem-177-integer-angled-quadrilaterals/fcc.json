  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals AC and BD. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner angles.</p>\n<p>For example, at vertex A, the two angles are CAD, CAB. We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer values when measured in degrees an \"integer angled quadrilateral\". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are 45°. Another example is given by DAC = 20°, BAC = 60°, ABD = 50°, CBD = 30°, BCA = 40°, DCA = 30°, CDB = 80°, ADB = 50°. What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals? Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of 10-9 of an integer value.</p>\n</section>",
