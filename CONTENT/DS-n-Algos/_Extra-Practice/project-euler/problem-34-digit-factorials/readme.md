# Problem 34: Digit factorials

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-34-digit-factorials)

145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the numbers and the sum of the numbers which are equal to the sum of the
factorial of their digits.

**Note:** as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
