# Problem 294: Sum of digits - experience #23

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-294-sum-of-digits---experience-23)

For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual
decimal representation.

Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.

For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k < 10n
with the following properties : k is divisible by 23 and d(k) = 23.

You are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.

Find S(1112) and give your answer mod 109.
