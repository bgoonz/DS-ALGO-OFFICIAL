  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions.</p>\n<p>Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers: \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of a), or</p>\n<p>\"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of b), or</p>\n<p>\"Yes, that's it!\" (and the game ends).</p>\n<p>Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost for the worst possible case.</p>\n<p>For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking \"2\" as our first question.</p>\n<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that \"1\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3). If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then our next question will be \"4\". If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that \"3\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5). If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then we are sure that \"5\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4). Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.</p>\n<p>Let C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples: C(5, 2, 3) = 5 C(500, √2, √3) = 13.22073197... C(20000, 5, 7) = 82 C(2000000, √5, √7) = 49.63755955...</p>\n<p>Let Fk be the Fibonacci numbers: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1.Find ∑1≤k≤30 C(1012, √k, √Fk), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\n</section>",
