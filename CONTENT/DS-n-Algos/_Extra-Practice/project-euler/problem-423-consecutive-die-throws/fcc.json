  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Let n be a positive integer.</p>\n<p>A 6-sided die is thrown n times. Let c be the number of pairs of consecutive throws that give the same value.</p>\n<p>For example, if n = 7 and the values of the die throws are (1,1,5,6,6,6,3), then the following pairs of consecutive throws give the same value: (1,1,5,6,6,6,3) (1,1,5,6,6,6,3) (1,1,5,6,6,6,3) Therefore, c = 3 for (1,1,5,6,6,6,3).</p>\n<p>Define C(n) as the number of outcomes of throwing a 6-sided die n times such that c does not exceed π(n).1 For example, C(3) = 216, C(4) = 1290, C(11) = 361912500 and C(24) = 4727547363281250000.</p>\n<p>Define S(L) as ∑ C(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ L. For example, S(50) mod 1 000 000 007 = 832833871.</p>\n<p>Find S(50 000 000) mod 1 000 000 007.</p>\n<p>1 π denotes the prime-counting function, i.e. π(n) is the number of primes ≤ n.</p>\n</section>",
