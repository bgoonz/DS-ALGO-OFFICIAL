<p>Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly (1 - x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50.</p>
<p>During each practice run, she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2, â€¦, x = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.</p>
<p>Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.</p>
