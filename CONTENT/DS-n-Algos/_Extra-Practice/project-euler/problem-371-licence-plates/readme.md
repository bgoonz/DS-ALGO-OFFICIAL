# Problem 371: Licence plates

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-371-licence-plates)

Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit number
(each digit can be from \[0..9\]).

While driving to work Seth plays the following game:

Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000 that's a
win.

E.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long as he
sees them in the same trip).

Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win. Give your answer
rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.

Note: We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three
digit number on it.
