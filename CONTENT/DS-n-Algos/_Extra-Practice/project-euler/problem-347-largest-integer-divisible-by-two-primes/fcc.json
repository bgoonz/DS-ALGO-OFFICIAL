  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The largest integer ≤ 100 that is only divisible by both the primes 2 and 3 is 96, as 96=32*3=25*3.</p>\n<p>For two distinct primes p and q let M(p,q,N) be the largest positive integer ≤N only divisible</p>\n<p>by both p and q and M(p,q,N)=0 if such a positive integer does not exist.</p>\n<p>E.g. M(2,3,100)=96. M(3,5,100)=75 and not 90 because 90 is divisible by 2 ,3 and 5. Also M(2,73,100)=0 because there does not exist a positive integer ≤ 100 that is divisible by both 2 and 73.</p>\n<p>Let S(N) be the sum of all distinct M(p,q,N). S(100)=2262.</p>\n<p>Find S(10 000 000).</p>\n</section>",
