  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Larry and Robin play a memory game involving of a sequence of random numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if his memory is full.</p>\n<p>Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove: Larry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time. Robin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time.</p>\n<p>Example game:Turn Callednumber Larry'smemory Larry'sscore Robin'smemory Robin'sscore 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 2 1,2 0 1,2 0 3 4 1,2,4 0 1,2,4 0 4 6 1,2,4,6 0 1,2,4,6 0 5 1 1,2,4,6 1 1,2,4,6 1 6 8 1,2,4,6,8 1 1,2,4,6,8 1 7 10 1,4,6,8,10 1 2,4,6,8,10 1 8 2 1,2,6,8,10 1 2,4,6,8,10 2 9 4 1,2,4,8,10 1 2,4,6,8,10 3 10 1 1,2,4,8,10 2 1,4,6,8,10 3</p>\n<p>Denoting Larry's score by L and Robin's score by R, what is the expected value of |L-R| after 50 turns?
