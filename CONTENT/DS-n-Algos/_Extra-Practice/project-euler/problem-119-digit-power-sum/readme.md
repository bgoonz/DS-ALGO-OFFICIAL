# Problem 119: Digit power sum

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-119-digit-power-sum)

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 83 = 512. Another example of a number
with this property is 614656 = 284.

We shall define an to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a number
must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that a2 = 512 and a10 = 614656.

Find a30.
