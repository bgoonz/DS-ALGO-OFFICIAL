  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation: b2x2 + b2y2 + a2z2 = a2b2.</p>\n<p>Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick. If a=1 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is</p>\n<p>283 Ï€ mm3</p>\n<!-- TODO Use MathJax -->\n<p>If a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm3.</p>\n<p>Find the amount of chocolate in mm3 required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm. Give your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\n</section>",
