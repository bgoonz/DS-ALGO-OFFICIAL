[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-449-chocolate-covered-candy)

Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each
candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation:
b2x2 + b2y2 + a2z2 = a2b2.

Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a
uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick. If a=1 mm and b=1 mm, the amount
of chocolate required is

283 Ï€ mm3

If a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately
60.35475635 mm3.

Find the amount of chocolate in mm3 required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm. Give your
answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.
