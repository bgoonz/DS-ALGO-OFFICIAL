<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-382-generating-polygons">FCC link</a></p>
<p>A polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that are joined to form a closed chain or circuit. A polygon consists of at least three sides and does not self-intersect.</p>
<p>A set S of positive numbers is said to generate a polygon P if: no two sides of P are the same length, the length of every side of P is in S, and S contains no other value.</p>
<p>For example: The set {3, 4, 5} generates a polygon with sides 3, 4, and 5 (a triangle). The set {6, 9, 11, 24} generates a polygon with sides 6, 9, 11, and 24 (a quadrilateral). The sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4, 9} do not generate any polygon at all.</p>
<p>Consider the sequence s, defined as follows:s1 = 1, s2 = 2, s3 = 3 sn = sn-1 + sn-3 for n &gt; 3.</p>
<p>Let Un be the set {s1, s2, â€¦, sn}. For example, U10 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28, 41}. Let f(n) be the number of subsets of Un which generate at least one polygon. For example, f(5) = 7, f(10) = 501 and f(25) = 18635853.</p>
<p>Find the last 9 digits of f(1018).</p>
