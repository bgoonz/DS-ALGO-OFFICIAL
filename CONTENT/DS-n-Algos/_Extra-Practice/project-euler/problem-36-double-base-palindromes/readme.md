# Problem 36: Double-base palindromes

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-36-double-base-palindromes)

The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than `n`, whereas 1000 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000000, which
are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include
leading zeros.)
