# Problem 131: Prime cube partnership

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-131-prime-cube-partnership)

There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.

For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the
value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
