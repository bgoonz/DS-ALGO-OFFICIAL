For 'zyx' there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.</p>\n<p>In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.</p>\n<p>We now consider strings of n â‰¤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.</p>\n<p>For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.</p>\n<p>What is the maximum value of p(n)?</p>\n</section>",
