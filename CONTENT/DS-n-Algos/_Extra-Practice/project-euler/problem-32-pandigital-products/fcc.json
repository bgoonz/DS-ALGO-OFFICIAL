  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>We shall say that an <code>n</code>-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to <code>n</code> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.</p>\n<p>The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.</p>\n</section>",
