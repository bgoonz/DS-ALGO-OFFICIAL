[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-227-the-chase)

"The Chase" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.

The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players having
one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it. If a player
rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if he rolls a 6, he
passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise, he keeps the die for
the next turn. The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been
rolled and passed; that player has then lost.
