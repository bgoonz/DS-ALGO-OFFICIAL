We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase. So $1=1*{\\varphi}$, $2=10.01*{\\varphi}$, $3=100.01*{\\varphi}$ and $14=100100.001001*{\\varphi}$. The strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are palindromic, while the string representing 3 is not. (the phigital point is not the middle character).</p>\n<p>The sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital representation is palindromic is 4345.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose phigital representation is palindromic.</p>\n</section>",
