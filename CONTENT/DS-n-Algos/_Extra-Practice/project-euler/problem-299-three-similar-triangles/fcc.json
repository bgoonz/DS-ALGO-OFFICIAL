Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.</p>\n<p>If b+d &#x3C; 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists. If b+d &#x3C; 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists. If b+d &#x3C; 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there such that point P exists?</p>\n</section>",
