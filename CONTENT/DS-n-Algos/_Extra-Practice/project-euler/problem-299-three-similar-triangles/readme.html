<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-299-three-similar-triangles">FCC link</a></p>
<p>Four points with integer coordinates are selected:A(a, 0), B(b, 0), C(0, c) and D(0, d),</p>
<p>with 0 &lt; a &lt; b and 0 &lt; c &lt; d.</p>
<p>Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.</p>
<p>It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.</p>
<p>So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at least one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.</p>
<p>For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point P(1,1) satisfies the above condition. Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.</p>
<p>If b+d &lt; 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists. If b+d &lt; 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists. If b+d &lt; 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there such that point P exists?</p>
