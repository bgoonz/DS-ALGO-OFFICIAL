It is very special, because</p>\n<p>3600 = 482 + 362 3600 = 202 + 2×402 3600 = 302 + 3×302 3600 = 452 + 7×152</p>\n<p>Similarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2×542 = 2832 + 3×522 = 1972 + 7×842.</p>\n<p>In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares. We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:</p>\n<p>n = a12 + b12n = a22 + 2 b22n = a32 + 3 b32n = a72 + 7 b72,</p>\n<p>where the ak and bk are positive integers.</p>\n<p>There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107.</p>\n<p>How many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2×109?</p>\n</section>",
