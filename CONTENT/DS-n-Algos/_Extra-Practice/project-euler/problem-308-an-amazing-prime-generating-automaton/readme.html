<p>A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.</p>
<p>The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.</p>
<p>For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:1791 , 7885 , 1951 , 2338 , 2933 , 7729 , 9523 , 7719 , 117 , 1113 , 1311 , 152 , 17 , 551 . Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce the sequence: 15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, …, 68, 4, 30, …, 136, 8, 60, …, 544, 32, 240, …</p>
<p>The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 22, 23, 25, … It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime exponents and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in proper order!</p>
<p>If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7 (find the 10001st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the program produces 210001st prime ?</p>
