# Problem 410: Circle and tangent line

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-410-circle-and-tangent-line)

Let C be the circle with radius r, x2 + y2 = r2. We choose two points P(a, b)
and Q(-a, c) so that the line passing through P and Q is tangent to C.

For example, the quadruplet (r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7) satisfies this
property.

Let F(R, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (r, a, b, c) with this
property, and with 0 < r ≤ R and 0 < a ≤ X.

We can verify that F(1, 5) = 10, F(2, 10) = 52 and F(10, 100) = 3384. Find
F(108, 109) + F(109, 108).
