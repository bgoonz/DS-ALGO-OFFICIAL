# Problem 17: Number letter counts

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-17-number-letter-counts)

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to given `limit` inclusive were written out in words,
how many letters would be used?

**Note:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and
forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20
letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British
usage.
