# Problem 110: Diophantine Reciprocals II

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-110-diophantine-reciprocals-ii)

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1/`x` + 1/`y` = 1/`n`

It can be verified that when `n` = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and
this is the least value of `n` for which the total number of distinct solutions
exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of `n` for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds four million?
