[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-239-twenty-two-foolish-primes)

A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random order.

What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly 22
prime number discs are found away from their natural positions? (Any number of
non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.)

Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form
0.abcdefghijkl.
