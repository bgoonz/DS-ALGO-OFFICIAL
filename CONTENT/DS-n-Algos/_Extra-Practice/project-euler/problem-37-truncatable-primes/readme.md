# Problem 37: Truncatable primes

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-37-truncatable-primes)

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible
to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each
stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797,
379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only `n` (8 ≤ `n` ≤ 11) primes that are both truncatable
from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
