# Problem 421: Prime factors of n15+1

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-421-prime-factors-of-n151)

Numbers of the form n15+1 are composite for every integer n > 1.

For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the distinct
prime factors of n15+1 not exceeding m.

E.g. 215+1 = 3×3×11×331. So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.

Also 1015+1 = 7×11×13×211×241×2161×9091. So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.
Find ∑ s(n,108) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1011.
