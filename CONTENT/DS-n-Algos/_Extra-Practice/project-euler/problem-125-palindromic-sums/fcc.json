  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 + 112 + 122.</p>\n<p>There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 02 + 12 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p>\n</section>",
