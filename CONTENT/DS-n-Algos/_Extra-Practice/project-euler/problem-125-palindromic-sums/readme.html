<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-125-palindromic-sums">FCC link</a></p>
<p>The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 + 112 + 122.</p>
<p>There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 02 + 12 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p>
