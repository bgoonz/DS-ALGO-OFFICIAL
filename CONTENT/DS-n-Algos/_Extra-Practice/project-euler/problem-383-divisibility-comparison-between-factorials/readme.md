# Problem 383: Divisibility comparison between factorials

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-383-divisibility-comparison-between-factorials)

Let f5(n) be the largest integer x for which 5x divides n.

For example, f5(625000) = 7.

Let T5(n) be the number of integers i which satisfy f5((2·i-1)!) < 2·f5(i!) and
1 ≤ i ≤ n. It can be verified that T5(103) = 68 and T5(109) = 2408210.

Find T5(1018).
