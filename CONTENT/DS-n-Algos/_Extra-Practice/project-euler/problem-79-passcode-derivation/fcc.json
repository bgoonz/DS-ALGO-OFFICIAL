  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.</p>\n<p>The array, <code>keylog</code>, contains fifty successful login attempts.</p>\n<p>Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyze the array so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.</p>\n</section>",
