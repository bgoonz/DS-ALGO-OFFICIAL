# Problem 79: Passcode derivation

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-79-passcode-derivation)

A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three
random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they
may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.

The array, `keylog`, contains fifty successful login attempts.

Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyze the array
so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.
