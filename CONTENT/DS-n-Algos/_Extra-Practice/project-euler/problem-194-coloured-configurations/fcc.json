  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Consider graphs built with the units A:</p>\n<p>and B: , where the units are glued along</p>\n<p>the vertical edges as in the graph .</p>\n<p>A configuration of type (a,b,c) is a graph thus built of a units A and b units B, where the graph's vertices are coloured using up to c colours, so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour. The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type (2,2,6), in fact of type (2,2,c) for all c â‰¥ 4.</p>\n<p>Let N(a,b,c) be the number of configurations of type (a,b,c). For example, N(1,0,3) = 24, N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736.</p>\n<p>Find the last 8 digits of N(25,75,1984).</p>\n</section>",
