# Problem 379: Least common multiple count

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-379-least-common-multiple-count)

Let f(n) be the number of couples (x,y) with x and y positive integers, x ≤ y
and the least common multiple of x and y equal to n.

Let g be the summatory function of f, i.e.: g(n) = ∑ f(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

You are given that g(106) = 37429395.

Find g(1012).
