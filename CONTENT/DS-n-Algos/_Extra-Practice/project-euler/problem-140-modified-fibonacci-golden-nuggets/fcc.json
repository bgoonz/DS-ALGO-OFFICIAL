  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Consider the infinite polynomial series AG(x) = xG1 + x2G2 + x3G3 + ..., where Gk is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation Gk = Gk−1 + Gk−2, G1 = 1 and G2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, ... .</p>\n<p>For this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which AG(x) is a positive integer.</p>\n<p>The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.</p>\n<p>xAG(x) (√5−1)/41 2/52 (√22−2)/63 (√137−5)/144 1/25</p>\n<p>We shall call AG(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365. Find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.</p>\n</section>",
