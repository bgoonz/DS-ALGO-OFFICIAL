<h1 id="problem-255-rounded-square-roots">Problem 255: Rounded Square Roots</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-255-rounded-square-roots">FCC link</a></p>
<p>We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square root of n rounded to the nearest integer.</p>
<p>The following procedure (essentially Heron’s method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n: Let d be the number of digits of the number n. If d is odd, set x0 = 2×10(d-1)⁄2. If d is even, set x0 = 7×10(d-2)⁄2. Repeat:</p>
<p>until xk+1 = xk.</p>
<p>As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n = 4321.n has 4 digits, so x0 = 7×10(4-2)⁄2 = 70. Since x2 = x1, we stop here. So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).</p>
<p>The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low. For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10,000 ≤ n ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).</p>
<p>Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number (1013 ≤ n &lt; 1014)? Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.</p>
<p>Note: The symbols ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉ represent the floor function and ceiling function respectively.</p>
