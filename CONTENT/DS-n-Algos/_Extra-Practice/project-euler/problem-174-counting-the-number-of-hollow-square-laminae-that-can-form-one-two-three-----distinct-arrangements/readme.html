<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-174-counting-the-number-of-hollow-square-laminae-that-can-form-one-two-three-----distinct-arrangements">FCC link</a></p>
<p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square “hole” so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>
<p>Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.</p>
<p>If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is type L(1) and t = 32 is type L(2). Let N(n) be the number of t ≤ 1000000 such that t is type L(n); for example, N(15) = 832. What is ∑ N(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10?</p>
