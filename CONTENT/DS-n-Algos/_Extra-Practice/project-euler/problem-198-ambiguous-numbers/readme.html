<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-198-ambiguous-numbers">FCC link</a></p>
<p>A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s ≤ d, so that any rational number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q &gt; d.</p>
<p>Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6. We shall call a real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.</p>
<p>How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q, 0 &lt; x &lt; 1/100, are there whose denominator q does not exceed 108?</p>
