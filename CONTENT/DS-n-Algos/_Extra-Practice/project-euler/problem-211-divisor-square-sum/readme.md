# Problem 211: Divisor Square Sum

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-211-divisor-square-sum)

For a positive integer n, let σ2(n) be the sum of the squares of its divisors.
For example,

σ2(10) = 1 + 4 + 25 + 100 = 130.

Find the sum of all n, 0 < n < 64,000,000 such that σ2(n) is a perfect square.
