<p>Consider the consecutive primes p1 = 19 and p2 = 23. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by p1 whilst also being divisible by p2.</p>
<p>In fact, with the exception of p1 = 3 and p2 = 5, for every pair of consecutive primes, p2 &gt; p1, there exist values of n for which the last digits are formed by p1 and n is divisible by p2. Let S be the smallest of these values of n.</p>
<p>Find ∑ S for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ p1 ≤ 1000000.</p>
