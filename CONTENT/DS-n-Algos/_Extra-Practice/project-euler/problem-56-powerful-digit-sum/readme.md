# Problem 56: Powerful digit sum

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-56-powerful-digit-sum)

A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100100
is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their
size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, `ab`, where `a`, `b` < 100, what is the
maximum digital sum?
