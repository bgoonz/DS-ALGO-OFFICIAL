  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>For an integer M, we define R(M) as the sum of 1/(p·q) for all the integer pairs p and q which satisfy all of these conditions:</p>\n<p>1 ≤ p &#x3C; q ≤ M p + q ≥ M p and q are coprime.</p>\n<p>We also define S(N) as the sum of R(i) for 2 ≤ i ≤ N. We can verify that S(2) = R(2) = 1/2, S(10) ≈ 6.9147 and S(100) ≈ 58.2962.</p>\n<p>Find S(107). Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.</p>\n</section>",
