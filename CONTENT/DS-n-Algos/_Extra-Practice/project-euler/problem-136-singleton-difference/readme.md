# Problem 136: Singleton difference

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-136-singleton-difference)

The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic
progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2 − y2 − z2 = n,
has exactly one solution when n = 20:

132 − 102 − 72 = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the
equation has a unique solution.

How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
