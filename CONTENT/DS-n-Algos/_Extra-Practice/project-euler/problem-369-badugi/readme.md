# Problem 369: Badugi

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-369-badugi)

In a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, a set of 4 cards is a Badugi if it
contains 4 cards with no pairs and no two cards of the same suit.

Let f(n) be the number of ways to choose n cards with a 4 card subset that is a
Badugi. For example, there are 2598960 ways to choose five cards from a standard
52 card deck, of which 514800 contain a 4 card subset that is a Badugi, so f(5)
= 514800.

Find ∑f(n) for 4 ≤ n ≤ 13.
