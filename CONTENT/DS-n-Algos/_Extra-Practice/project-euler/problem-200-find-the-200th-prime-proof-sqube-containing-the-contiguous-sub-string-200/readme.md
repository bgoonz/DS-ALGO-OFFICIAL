# Problem 200: Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200"

We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p2q3, where p and q are
distinct primes.

For example, 200 = 5223 or 120072949 = 232613.

The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.

Interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change any
single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next
prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008.

Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".
