  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A set of lattice points S is called a titanic set if there exists a line passing through exactly two points in S.</p>\n<p>An example of a titanic set is S = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)}, where the line passing through (0, 1) and (2, 0) does not pass through any other point in S.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)} is not a titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set also passes through the other two.</p>\n<p>For any positive integer N, let T(N) be the number of titanic sets S whose every point (x, y) satisfies 0 ≤ x, y ≤ N. It can be verified that T(1) = 11, T(2) = 494, T(4) = 33554178, T(111) mod 108 = 13500401 and T(105) mod 108 = 63259062.</p>\n<p>Find T(1011) mod 108.</p>\n</section>",
