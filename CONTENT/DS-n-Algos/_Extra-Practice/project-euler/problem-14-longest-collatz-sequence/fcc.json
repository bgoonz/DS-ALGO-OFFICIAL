Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.</p>\n<p>Which starting number, under the given <code>limit</code>, produces the longest chain?</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.</p>\n</section>",
