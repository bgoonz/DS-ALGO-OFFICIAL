  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A positive integer n is powerful if p2 is a divisor of n for every prime factor p in n.</p>\n<p>A positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power of another positive integer.</p>\n<p>A positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 = 25·33 and 1800 = 23·32·52.</p>\n<p>We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and φ(S) are Achilles numbers.1 For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: φ(864) = 288 = 25·32. However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: φ(1800) = 480 = 25·31·51.</p>\n<p>There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 104 and 656 below 108.</p>\n<p>How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 1018?</p>\n<p>1 φ denotes Euler's totient function.</p>\n</section>",
