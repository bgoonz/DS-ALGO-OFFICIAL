Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a
60-degree triangle.

Let r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.

There are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r ≤ 100.

Let T(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r ≤ n, so

T(100) = 1234, T(1000) = 22767, and T(10000) = 359912.

Find T(1053779).
