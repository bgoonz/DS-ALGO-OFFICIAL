[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-40-champernownes-constant)

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive
integers:

0.12345678910**1**112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If _dn_ represents the \_n_th digit of the fractional part, find the value of
the following expression.

d1 × d10 × d100 × d1000 × d10000 × d100000 × d1000000
