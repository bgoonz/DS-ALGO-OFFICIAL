<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-116-red-green-or-blue-tiles">FCC link</a></p>
<p>A row of five black square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green (length three), or blue (length four).</p>
<p>If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.</p>
<p>If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.</p>
<p>And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.</p>
<p>Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of replacing the black tiles in a row measuring five units in length. How many different ways can the black tiles in a row measuring fifty units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least one coloured tile must be used? NOTE: This is related to Problem 117.</p>
