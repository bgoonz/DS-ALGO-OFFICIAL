# Problem 39: Integer right triangles

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-39-integer-right-triangles)

If `p` is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of `p` â‰¤ `n`, is the number of solutions maximized?
