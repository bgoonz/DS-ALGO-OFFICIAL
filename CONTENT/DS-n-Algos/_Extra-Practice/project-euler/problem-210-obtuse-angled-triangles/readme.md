# Problem 210: Obtuse Angled Triangles

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-210-obtuse-angled-triangles)

Consider the set S(r) of points (x,y) with integer coordinates satisfying |x| +
|y| ≤ r.

Let O be the point (0,0) and C the point (r/4,r/4).

Let N(r) be the number of points B in S(r), so that the triangle OBC has an
obtuse angle, i.e. the largest angle α satisfies 90°<α<180°.

So, for example, N(4)=24 and N(8)=100.

What is N(1,000,000,000)?
