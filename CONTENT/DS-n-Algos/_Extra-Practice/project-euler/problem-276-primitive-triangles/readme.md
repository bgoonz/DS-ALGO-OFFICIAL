# Problem 276: Primitive Triangles

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-276-primitive-triangles)

Consider the triangles with integer sides a, b and c with a ≤ b ≤ c.

An integer sided triangle (a,b,c) is called primitive if gcd(a,b,c)=1.

How many primitive integer sided triangles exist with a perimeter not exceeding
10 000 000?
