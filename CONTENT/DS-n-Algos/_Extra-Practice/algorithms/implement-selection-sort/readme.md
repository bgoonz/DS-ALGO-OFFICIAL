# Implement Selection Sort

[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/implement-selection-sort)

Here we will implement selection sort. Selection sort works by selecting the
minimum value in a list and swapping it with the first value in the list. It
then starts at the second position, selects the smallest value in the remaining
list, and swaps it with the second element. It continues iterating through the
list and swapping elements until it reaches the end of the list. Now the list is
sorted. Selection sort has quadratic time complexity in all cases.

**Instructions**: Write a function `selectionSort` which takes an array of
integers as input and returns an array of these integers in sorted order from
least to greatest.
