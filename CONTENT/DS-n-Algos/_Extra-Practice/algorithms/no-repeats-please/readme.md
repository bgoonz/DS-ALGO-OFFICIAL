# No Repeats Please

Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have
repeated consecutive letters. Assume that all characters in the provided string
are each unique.

For example, `aab` should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations (`aab`,
`aab`, `aba`, `aba`, `baa`, `baa`), but only 2 of them (`aba` and `aba`) don't
have the same letter (in this case `a`) repeating.
