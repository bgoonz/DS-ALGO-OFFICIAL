[FCC link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/inventory-update)

Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array
of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in
`arr1`). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the
inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by
item.
