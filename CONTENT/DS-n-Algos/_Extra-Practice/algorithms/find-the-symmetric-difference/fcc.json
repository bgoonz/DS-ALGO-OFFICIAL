  "htmlDescription": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The mathematical term <dfn>symmetric difference</dfn> (<code>△</code> or <code>⊕</code>) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both. For example, for sets <code>A = {1, 2, 3}</code> and <code>B = {2, 3, 4}</code>, <code>A △ B = {1, 4}</code>.</p>\n<p>Symmetric difference is a binary operation, which means it operates on only two elements. So to evaluate an expression involving symmetric differences among <em>three</em> elements (<code>A △ B △ C</code>), you must complete one operation at a time. Thus, for sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> above, and <code>C = {2, 3}</code>, <code>A △ B △ C = (A △ B) △ C = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}</code>.</p>\n</section>",
