    Problem statement and Explanation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers

    In number theory, two integers a and b are coprime, relatively prime or
    mutually prime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both
    of them is Consequently, any prime number that divides one of a
    or b does not divide the other. This is equivalent to their greatest
    common divisor (gcd) being. One says also a is prime to b or a
    is coprime with b.
