/**
 * Problem statement and explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm
 *
 * This algorithm plays an important role for modular arithmetic, and by extension for cyptography algorithms
 *
 * Basic explanation:
 * The Extended Euclidean algorithm is a modification of the standard Euclidean GCD algorithm.
 * It allows to calculate coefficients x and y for the equation:
 *          ax + by = gcd(a,b)
 *
 * This is called Bézout's identity and the coefficients are called Bézout coefficients
 *
 * The algorithm uses the Euclidean method of getting remainder:
 * r_i+1 = r_i-1 - qi*ri
 * and applies it to series s and t (with same quotient q at each stage)
 * When r_n reaches 0, the value r_n-1 gives the gcd, and s_n-1 and t_n-1 give the coefficients
 *
 * This implementation uses an iterative approach to calculate the values
