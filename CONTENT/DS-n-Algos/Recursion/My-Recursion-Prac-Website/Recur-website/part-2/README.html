      This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project
      from the <a href="http://hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a> curriculum.
      This project was worked on with a pair, and as such is representative of
      the kind of problems that Iâ€™ve tackled, but not of my solo work.
    </p>

      For a better perspective on my own work, please see
