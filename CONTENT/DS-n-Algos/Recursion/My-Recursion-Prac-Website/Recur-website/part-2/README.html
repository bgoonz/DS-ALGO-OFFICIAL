<p>This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from the <a href="http://hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a> curriculum. This project was worked on with a pair, and as such is representative of the kind of problems that I’ve tackled, but not of my solo work.</p>
<p>For a better perspective on my own work, please see <a href="https://github.com/tylermcginnis33/CoderCombat">CoderCombat</a>.</p>
