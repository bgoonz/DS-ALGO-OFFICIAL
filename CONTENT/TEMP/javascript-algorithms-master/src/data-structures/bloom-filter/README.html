      A <strong>bloom filter</strong> is a space-efficient probabilistic data
      structure designed to test whether an element is present in a set. It is
      designed to be blazingly fast and use minimal memory at the cost of
      potential false positives. False positive matches are possible, but false
      negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either “possibly in
      set” or “definitely not in set”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bloom proposed the technique for applications where the amount of source
      data would require an impractically large amount of memory if
      “conventional” error-free hashing techniques were applied.
    </p>
    <h2 id="algorithm-description">Algorithm description</h2>
    <p>
      An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of <code>m</code> bits, all set to
      <code>0</code>. There must also be <code>k</code> different hash functions
      defined, each of which maps or hashes some set element to one of the
      <code>m</code> array positions, generating a uniform random distribution.
      Typically, <code>k</code> is a constant, much smaller than <code>m</code>,
      which is proportional to the number of elements to be added; the precise
      choice of <code>k</code> and the constant of proportionality of
      <code>m</code> are determined by the intended false positive rate of the
      filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a Bloom filter, representing the set
      <code>{x, y, z}</code>. The colored arrows show the positions in the bit
      array that each set element is mapped to. The element <code>w</code> is
      not in the set <code>{x, y, z}</code>, because it hashes to one bit-array
      position containing <code>0</code>. For this figure,
      <code>m = 18</code> and <code>k = 3</code>.

    <h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
    <p>
      There are two main operations a bloom filter can perform:
      <em>insertion</em> and <em>search</em>. Search may result in false
      positives. Deletion is not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, the filter can take in items. When we go to check if an
      item has previously been inserted, it can tell us either “no” or “maybe”.
    </p>
    <p>Both insertion and search are <code>O(1)</code> operations.</p>
    <h2 id="making-the-filter">Making the filter</h2>
    <p>
      A bloom filter is created by allotting a certain size. In our example, we
      use <code>100</code> as a default length. All locations are initialized to
      <code>false</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="insertion">Insertion</h3>
    <p>
      During insertion, a number of hash functions, in our case
      <code>3</code> hash functions, are used to create hashes of the input.
      These hash functions output indexes. At every index received, we simply
      change the value in our bloom filter to <code>true</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="search">Search</h3>
    <p>
      During a search, the same hash functions are called and used to hash the
      input. We then check if the indexes received <em>all</em> have a value of
      <code>true</code> inside our bloom filter. If they <em>all</em> have a
      value of <code>true</code>, we know that the bloom filter may have had the
      value previously inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it’s not certain, because it’s possible that other values
      previously inserted flipped the values to <code>true</code>. The values
      aren’t necessarily <code>true</code> due to the item currently being
      searched for. Absolute certainty is impossible unless only a single item
      has previously been inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While checking the bloom filter for the indexes returned by our hash
      functions, if even one of them has a value of <code>false</code>, we
      definitively know that the item was not previously inserted.
    </p>
    <h2 id="false-positives">False Positives</h2>
    <p>
      The probability of false positives is determined by three factors: the
      size of the bloom filter, the number of hash functions we use, and the
      number of items that have been inserted into the filter.
    </p>
    <p>The formula to calculate probablity of a false positive is:</p>
    <p>( 1 - e <sup>-kn/m</sup> ) <sup>k</sup></p>
    <p><code>k</code> = number of hash functions</p>
    <p><code>m</code> = filter size</p>
    <p><code>n</code> = number of items inserted</p>
    <p>
      These variables, <code>k</code>, <code>m</code>, and <code>n</code>,
      should be picked based on how acceptable false positives are. If the
      values are picked and the resulting probability is too high, the values
      should be tweaked and the probability re-calculated.
    </p>
    <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
    <p>
      A bloom filter can be used on a blogging website. If the goal is to show
      readers only articles that they have never seen before, a bloom filter is
      perfect. It can store hashed values based on the articles. After a user
      reads a few articles, they can be inserted into the filter. The next time
      the user visits the site, those articles can be filtered out of the
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some articles will inevitably be filtered out by mistake, but the cost is
      acceptable. It’s ok if a user never sees a few articles as long as they
      have other, brand new ones to see every time they visit the site.
