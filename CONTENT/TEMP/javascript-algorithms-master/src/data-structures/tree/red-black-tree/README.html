    <p>
      A <strong>red–black tree</strong> is a kind of self-balancing binary
      search tree in computer science. Each node of the binary tree has an extra
      bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color (red or black) of the
      node. These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately
      balanced during insertions and deletions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balance is preserved by painting each node of the tree with one of two
      colors in a way that satisfies certain properties, which collectively
      constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. When the
      tree is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted to
      restore the coloring properties. The properties are designed in such a way
      that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balancing of the tree is not perfect, but it is good enough to allow
      it to guarantee searching in <code>O(log n)</code> time, where
      <code>n</code> is the total number of elements in the tree. The insertion
      and deletion operations, along with the tree rearrangement and recoloring,
      are also performed in <code>O(log n)</code> time.

    <p>
      In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the
      following must be satisfied by a red–black tree:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each node is either red or black.</li>
      <li>
        The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can
        always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice versa,
        this rule has little effect on analysis.
      </li>
      <li>All leaves (NIL) are black.</li>
      <li>If a node is red, then both its children are black.</li>
      <li>
        Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains
        the same number of black nodes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some definitions: the number of black nodes from the root to a node is the
      node’s <strong>black depth</strong>; the uniform number of black nodes in
      all paths from root to the leaves is called the
      <strong>black-height</strong> of the red–black tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      These constraints enforce a critical property of red–black trees:
      <em
        >the path from the root to the farthest leaf is no more than twice as
        long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf</em
      >. The result is that the tree is roughly height-balanced. Since
      operations such as inserting, deleting, and finding values require
      worst-case time proportional to the height of the tree, this theoretical
      upper bound on the height allows red–black trees to be efficient in the
      worst case, unlike ordinary binary search trees.
