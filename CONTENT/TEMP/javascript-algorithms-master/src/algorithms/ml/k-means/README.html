<h1 id="k-means-algorithm">k-Means Algorithm</h1>
<p>The <strong>k-Means algorithm</strong> is an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm. Itâ€™s a clustering algorithm, which groups the sample data on the basis of similarity between dimensions of vectors.</p>
<p>In k-Means classification, the output is a set of classes assigned to each vector. Each cluster location is continuously optimized in order to get the accurate locations of each cluster such that they represent each group clearly.</p>
<p>The idea is to calculate the similarity between cluster location and data vectors, and reassign clusters based on it. <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/math/euclidean-distance">Euclidean distance</a> is used mostly for this task.</p>

<p>The algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check for errors like invalid/inconsistent data</li>
<li>Initialize the <code>k</code> cluster locations with initial/random <code>k</code> points</li>
<li>Calculate the distance of each data point from each cluster</li>
<li>Assign the cluster label of each data point equal to that of the cluster at its minimum distance</li>
<li>Calculate the centroid of each cluster based on the data points it contains</li>
<li>Repeat each of the above steps until the centroid locations are varying</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a visualization of k-Means clustering for better understanding:</p>

<p>The centroids are moving continuously in order to create better distinction between the different set of data points. As we can see, after a few iterations, the difference in centroids is quite low between iterations. For example between iterations <code>13</code> and <code>14</code> the difference is quite small because there the optimizer is tuning boundary cases.</p>
