      Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    </h1>
    <h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
    <p>
      Say you have an array prices for which the <code>i</code>-th element is
      the price of a given stock on day <code>i</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like
      (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time
        (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example #1</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 7</code></pre>
    <p>
      <em>Explanation:</em> Buy on day <code>2</code> (<code>price = 1</code>)
      and sell on day <code>3</code> (<code>price = 5</code>),
      <code>profit = 5-1 = 4</code>. Then buy on day <code>4</code> (<code
        >price = 3</code
      >) and sell on day <code>5</code> (<code>price = 6</code>),
      <code>profit = 6-3 = 3</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example #2</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 4</code></pre>
    <p>
      <em>Explanation:</em> Buy on day <code>1</code> (<code>price = 1</code>)
      and sell on day <code>5</code> (<code>price = 5</code>),
      <code>profit = 5-1 = 4</code>. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on
      day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at
      the same time. You must sell before buying again.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example #3</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0</code></pre>
    <p>
      <em>Explanation:</em> In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max
      <code>profit = 0</code>.

      Divide and conquer approach <code>O(2^n)</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      We may try <strong>all</strong> combinations of buying and selling and
      find out the most profitable one by applying
      <em>divide and conquer approach</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say we have an array of prices <code>[7, 6, 4, 3, 1]</code> and
      we’re on the <em>1st</em> day of trading (at the very beginning of the
      array). At this point we may say that the overall maximum profit would be
      the <em>maximum</em> of two following values:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <em>Option 1: Keep the money</em> → profit would equal to the profit
        from buying/selling the rest of the stocks →
        <code>keepProfit = profit([6, 4, 3, 1])</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Option 2: Buy/sell at current price</em> → profit in this case would
        equal to the profit from buying/selling the rest of the stocks plus (or
        minus, depending on whether we’re selling or buying) the current stock
        price → <code>buySellProfit = -7 + profit([6, 4, 3, 1])</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The overall profit would be equal to →
      <code>overalProfit = Max(keepProfit, buySellProfit)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see the <code>profit([6, 4, 3, 1])</code> task is being solved
      in the same recursive manner.

    <h4 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h4>
    <p>
      As you may see, every recursive call will produce <em>2</em> more
      recursive branches. The depth of the recursion will be
      <code>n</code> (size of prices array) and thus, the time complexity will
      equal to <code>O(2^n)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you may see, this is very inefficient. For example for just
      <code>20</code> prices the number of recursive calls will be somewhere
      close to <code>2M</code>!
    </p>
    <h4 id="additional-space-complexity">Additional Space Complexity</h4>
    <p>
      If we avoid cloning the prices array between recursive function calls and
      will use the array pointer then additional space complexity will be
      proportional to the depth of the recursion: <code>O(n)</code>
    </p>
    <h2 id="peak-valley-approach-on">Peak Valley Approach <code>O(n)</code></h2>
    <p>
      If we plot the prices array (i.e. <code>[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]</code>) we may
      notice that the points of interest are the consecutive valleys and peaks

      So, if we will track the growing price and will sell the stocks
      immediately <em>before</em> the price goes down we’ll get the maximum
      profit (remember, we bought the stock in the valley at its low price).

    <h4 id="time-complexity-1">Time Complexity</h4>
    <p>
      Since the algorithm requires only one pass through the prices array, the
      time complexity would equal <code>O(n)</code>.

    <h4 id="additional-space-complexity-1">Additional Space Complexity</h4>
    <p>
      Except of the prices array itself the algorithm consumes the constant
      amount of memory. Thus, additional space complexity is <code>O(1)</code>.

      There is even simpler approach exists. Let’s say we have the prices array
      which looks like this <code>[1, 7, 2, 3, 6, 7, 6, 7]</code>:

      You may notice, that we don’t even need to keep tracking of a constantly
      growing price. Instead, we may simply add the price difference for
      <em>all growing segments</em> of the chart which eventually sums up to the
      highest possible profit,
