    <h1 id="n-queens-problem">N-Queens Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>eight queens puzzle</strong> is the problem of placing eight
      chess queens on an <code>8×8</code> chessboard so that no two queens
      threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share
      the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example
      of the more general <em>n queens problem</em> of placing n non-attacking
      queens on an <code>n×n</code> chessboard, for which solutions exist for
      all natural numbers <code>n</code> with the exception of
      <code>n=2</code> and <code>n=3</code>.
    </p>
    <p>For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.</p>

    <p>
      The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where
      queens are placed. For example following is the output matrix for above 4
      queen solution.
    </p>
    <pre><code>{ 0,  1,  0,  0}
{ 0,  0,  0,  1}
{ 1,  0,  0,  0}
{ 0,  0,  1,  0}</code></pre>
    <h2 id="naive-algorithm">Naive Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      Generate all possible configurations of queens on board and print a
      configuration that satisfies the given constraints.
    </p>
    <pre><code>while there are untried configurations
{
   generate the next configuration
   if queens don&#39;t attack in this configuration then
   {
      print this configuration;
   }
}</code></pre>
    <h2 id="backtracking-algorithm">Backtracking Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from
      the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a column, we check for
      clashes with already placed queens. In the current column, if we find a
      row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part of
      the solution. If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we
      backtrack and return false.
    </p>
    <pre><code>1) Start in the leftmost column
2) If all queens are placed
    return true
3) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following for every tried row.
    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row then mark this [row, 
        column] as part of the solution and recursively check if placing  
        queen here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing queen in [row, column] leads to a solution then return 
        true.
    c) If placing queen doesn&#39;t lead to a solution then umark this [row, 
        column] (Backtrack) and go to step (a) to try other rows.
3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger 
    backtracking.</code></pre>
    <h2 id="bitwise-solution">Bitwise Solution</h2>
    <p>Bitwise algorithm basically approaches the problem like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Queens can attack diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. As a result,
        there can only be one queen in each row, one in each column, and at most
        one on each diagonal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since we know there can only one queen per row, we will start at the
        first row, place a queen, then move to the second row, place a second
        queen, and so on until either a) we reach a valid solution or b) we
        reach a dead end (ie. we can’t place a queen such that it is “safe” from
        the other queens).
      </li>
      <li>
        Since we are only placing one queen per row, we don’t need to worry
        about horizontal attacks, since no queen will ever be on the same row as
        another queen.
      </li>
      <li>
        That means we only need to check three things before placing a queen on
        a certain square: 1) The square’s column doesn’t have any other queens
        on it, 2) the square’s left diagonal doesn’t have any other queens on
        it, and 3) the square’s right diagonal doesn’t have any other queens on
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we ever reach a point where there is nowhere safe to place a queen,
        we can give up on our current attempt and immediately test out the next
        possibility.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First let’s talk about the recursive function. You’ll notice that it
      accepts 3 parameters: <code>leftDiagonal</code>, <code>column</code>, and
      <code>rightDiagonal</code>. Each of these is technically an integer, but
      the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that an integer is represented
      by a sequence of bits. So, think of each of these parameters as a sequence
      of <code>N</code> bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each bit in each of the parameters represents whether the corresponding
      location on the current row is “available”.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: - For <code>N=4</code>, column having a value of
      <code>0010</code> would mean that the 3rd column is already occupied by a
      queen. - For <code>N=8</code>, ld having a value of
      <code>00011000</code> at row 5 would mean that the
      top-left-to-bottom-right diagonals that pass through columns 4 and 5 of
      that row are already occupied by queens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a visual aid for <code>leftDiagonal</code>, <code>column</code>,
      and <code>rightDiagonal</code>.
