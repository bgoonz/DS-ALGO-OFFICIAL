<h1 id="least-common-multiple">Least common multiple</h1>
<p>In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, usually denoted by <code>LCM(a, b)</code>, is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both different from zero. However, some authors define <code>lcm(a,0)</code> as <code>0</code> for all <code>a</code>, which is the result of taking the <code>lcm</code> to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>What is the LCM of 4 and 6?</p>
<p>Multiples of <code>4</code> are:</p>
<pre><code>4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, ...</code></pre>
<p>and the multiples of <code>6</code> are:</p>
<pre><code>6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, ...</code></pre>
<p>Common multiples of <code>4</code> and <code>6</code> are simply the numbers that are in both lists:</p>
<pre><code>12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ....</code></pre>
<p>So, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers <code>4</code> and <code>6</code>, their least common multiple is <code>12</code>.</p>
<h2 id="computing-the-least-common-multiple">Computing the least common multiple</h2>
<p>The following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:</p>
<pre><code>lcm(a, b) = |a * b| / gcd(a, b)</code></pre>

<p>For example, a card game which requires its cards to be divided equally among up to <code>5</code> players requires at least <code>60</code> cards, the number at the intersection of the <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code> and <code>5</code> sets, but not the <code>7</code> set.</p>
