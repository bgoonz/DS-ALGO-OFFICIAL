    <h1 id="horners-method">Horner’s Method</h1>
    <p>
      In mathematics, Horner’s method (or Horner’s scheme) is an algorithm for
      polynomial evaluation. With this method, it is possible to evaluate a
      polynomial with only <code>n</code> additions and
      <code>n</code> multiplications. Hence, its storage requirements are
      <code>n</code> times the number of bits of <code>x</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Horner’s method can be based on the following identity:</p>

      <figcaption>Horner’s rule</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This identity is called <em>Horner’s rule</em>.</p>
    <p>
      To solve the right part of the identity above, for a given <code>x</code>,
      we start by iterating through the polynomial from the inside out,
      accumulating each iteration result. After <code>n</code> iterations, with
      <code>n</code> being the order of the polynomial, the accumulated result
      gives us the polynomial evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Using the polynomial:</strong>
      <code>4 * x^4 + 2 * x^3 + 3 * x^2 + x^1 + 3</code>, a traditional approach
      to evaluate it at <code>x = 2</code>, could be representing it as an array
      <code>[3, 1, 3, 2, 4]</code> and iterate over it saving each iteration
      value at an accumulator, such as
      <code>acc += pow(x=2, index) * array[index]</code>. In essence, each power
      of a number (<code>pow</code>) operation is
      <code>n-1</code> multiplications. So, in this scenario, a total of
      <code>14</code> operations would have happened, composed of
      <code>4</code> additions, <code>5</code> multiplications, and
      <code>5</code> pows (we’re assuming that each power is calculated by
      repeated multiplication).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, <strong>using the same scenario but with Horner’s rule</strong>, the
      polynomial can be re-written as
      <code>x * (x * (x * (4 * x + 2) + 3) + 1) + 3</code>, representing it as
      <code>[4, 2, 3, 1, 3]</code> it is possible to save the first iteration as
      <code>acc = arr[0] * (x=2) + arr[1]</code>, and then finish iterations for
      <code>acc *= (x=2) + arr[index]</code>. In the same scenario but using
      Horner’s rule, a total of <code>10</code> operations would have happened,
      composed of only <code>4</code> additions and
      <code>4</code> multiplications.
