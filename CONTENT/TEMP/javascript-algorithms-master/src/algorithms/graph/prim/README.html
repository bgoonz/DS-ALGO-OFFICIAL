<h1 id="prims-algorithm">Prim’s Algorithm</h1>
<p>In computer science, <strong>Prim’s algorithm</strong> is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.</p>
<p>The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.</p>

<p>Prim’s algorithm starting at vertex <code>A</code>. In the third step, edges <code>BD</code> and <code>AB</code> both have weight <code>2</code>, so <code>BD</code> is chosen arbitrarily. After that step, <code>AB</code> is no longer a candidate for addition to the tree because it links two nodes that are already in the tree.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-spanning-tree">Minimum Spanning Tree</h2>
<p>A <strong>minimum spanning tree</strong> (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted (un)directed graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.</p>

<p>This figure shows there may be more than one minimum spanning tree in a graph. In the figure, the two trees below the graph are two possibilities of minimum spanning tree of the given graph.</p>
