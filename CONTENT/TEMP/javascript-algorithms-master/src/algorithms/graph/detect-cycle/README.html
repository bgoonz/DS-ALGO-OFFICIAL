<h1 id="detect-cycle-in-graphs">Detect Cycle in Graphs</h1>
<p>In graph theory, a <strong>cycle</strong> is a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself. There are several different types of cycles, principally a <strong>closed walk</strong> and a <strong>simple cycle</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>A <strong>closed walk</strong> consists of a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertex, with each two consecutive vertices in the sequence adjacent to each other in the graph. In a directed graph, each edge must be traversed by the walk consistently with its direction: the edge must be oriented from the earlier of two consecutive vertices to the later of the two vertices in the sequence. The choice of starting vertex is not important: traversing the same cyclic sequence of edges from different starting vertices produces the same closed walk.</p>
<p>A <strong>simple cycle may</strong> be defined either as a closed walk with no repetitions of vertices and edges allowed, other than the repetition of the starting and ending vertex, or as the set of edges in such a walk. The two definitions are equivalent in directed graphs, where simple cycles are also called directed cycles: the cyclic sequence of vertices and edges in a walk is completely determined by the set of edges that it uses. In undirected graphs the set of edges of a cycle can be traversed by a walk in either of two directions, giving two possible directed cycles for every undirected cycle. A circuit can be a closed walk allowing repetitions of vertices but not edges; however, it can also be a simple cycle, so explicit definition is recommended when it is used.</p>
