<h1 id="topological-sorting">Topological Sorting</h1>
<p>In the field of computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge <code>uv</code> from vertex <code>u</code> to vertex <code>v</code>, <code>u</code> comes before <code>v</code> in the ordering.</p>
<p>For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.</p>
<p>A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and algorithms are known for constructing a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time.</p>

<p>A topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph: every edge goes from earlier in the ordering (upper left) to later in the ordering (lower right). A directed graph is acyclic if and only if it has a topological ordering.</p>

<p>The graph shown above has many valid topological sorts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5, 7, 3, 11, 8, 2, 9, 10</code> (visual left-to-right, top-to-bottom)</li>
<li><code>3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 2, 9, 10</code> (smallest-numbered available vertex first)</li>
<li><code>5, 7, 3, 8, 11, 10, 9, 2</code> (fewest edges first)</li>
<li><code>7, 5, 11, 3, 10, 8, 9, 2</code> (largest-numbered available vertex first)</li>
<li><code>5, 7, 11, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10</code> (attempting top-to-bottom, left-to-right)</li>
<li><code>3, 7, 8, 5, 11, 10, 2, 9</code> (arbitrary)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<p>The canonical application of topological sorting is in <strong>scheduling a sequence of jobs</strong> or tasks based on their dependencies. The jobs are represented by vertices, and there is an edge from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code> if job <code>x</code> must be completed before job <code>y</code> can be started (for example, when washing clothes, the washing machine must finish before we put the clothes in the dryer). Then, a topological sort gives an order in which to perform the jobs.</p>
<p>Other application is <strong>dependency resolution</strong>. Each vertex is a package and each edge is a dependency of package <code>a</code> on package ‘b’. Then topological sorting will provide a sequence of installing dependencies in a way that every next dependency has its dependent packages to be installed in prior.</p>
