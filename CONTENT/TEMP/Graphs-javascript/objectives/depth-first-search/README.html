    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      When searching a graph, one of the approaches is called
      <em>depth first search</em>. This “dives” “down” the graph as far as it
      can before needing to backtrack and explore another branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The algorithm never attempts to explore a vert that it either has explored
      or is exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when starting from the upper left, the numbers on this graph
      show a vertex visitation order in a DFS:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="img/dfs-visit-order.png" alt="DFS visit order" />
      <figcaption>DFS visit order</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The bold lines show with edges were followed. (The thin edges were not
      followed since their destination nodes had already been visited.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (Of course, the exact order will vary depending on which branches get
      taken first and which vertex is the starting vertex.)

    <h2 id="coloring-vertexes">Coloring Vertexes</h2>
    <p>
      As the graph is explored, it’s useful to color verts as you arrive at them
      and as you leave them behind as “already searched”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commonly, unvisited verts are white, verts whose neighbors are being
      explored are gray, and verts with no unexplored neighbors are black.
    </p>
    <h2 id="recursion">Recursion</h2>
    <p>
      Since we want to pursue leads in the graph as far as we can, and then
      “back up” to an earlier branch point to explore that way, recursion is a
      good approach to help “remember” where we left off.
    </p>
    <p>Looking at it with pseudocode to make the recursion more apparent:</p>
    <pre class="pseudocode"><code>explore(graph) {
    visit(this_vert);
    explore(remaining_graph);
}</code></pre>
    <h2 id="pseudocode-for-dfs">Pseudocode for DFS</h2>
    <pre class="pseudocode"><code>DFS(graph):
    for v of graph.verts:
        v.color = white
        v.parent = null

    for v of graph.verts:
        if v.color == white:
            DFS_visit(v)

DFS_visit(v):
    v.color = gray

    for neighbor of v.adjacent_nodes:
        if neighbor.color == white:
            neighbor.parent = v
            DFS_visit(neighbor)

    v.color = black
</code></pre>
