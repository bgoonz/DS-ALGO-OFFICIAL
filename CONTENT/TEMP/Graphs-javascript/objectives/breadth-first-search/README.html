    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      When searching a graph, one of the approaches is called
      <em>breadth first search</em>. This explores the graph outward in rings of
      ever increasing distance from the starting vertex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The algorithm never attempts to explore a vert that it either has explored
      or is exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when starting from the upper left, the numbers on this graph
      show a vertex visitation order in a BFS:
    </p>

      <img src="img/bfs-visit-order.png" alt="BFS visit order" />
      <figcaption>BFS visit order</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The bold lines show with edges were followed. (The thin edges were not
      followed since their destination nodes had already been visited.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (Of course, the exact order will vary depending on which branches get
      taken first and which vertex is the starting vertex.)

    <h2 id="coloring-vertexes">Coloring Vertexes</h2>
    <p>
      As the graph is explored, it’s useful to color verts as you arrive at them
      and as you leave them behind as “already searched”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commonly, unvisited verts are white, verts whose neighbors are being
      explored are gray, and verts with no unexplored neighbors are black.
    </p>
    <h2 id="keeping-track-of-what-we-need-to-explore">
      Keeping Track of What We Need to Explore
    </h2>
    <p>
      In BFS, it’s useful to track which nodes we need to follow up on. For
      example, in the diagram above, when we get to node 2, we need to explore
      node 3 and 4 in the future, in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can track that by adding neighbors to a <em>queue</em>, and then
      exploring the verts in the queue.
    </p>
    <h2 id="pseudocode-for-bfs">Pseudocode for BFS</h2>
    <pre class="pseudocode"><code>BFS(graph, startVert):
  for v of graph.vertexes:
    v.color = white

  startVert.color = gray
  queue.enqueue(startVert)

  while !queue.isEmpty():
    u = queue[0]  // Peek at head of queue, but do not dequeue!

    for v of u.neighbors:
      if v.color == white:
        v.color = gray
        queue.enqueue(v)

    queue.dequeue()
    u.color = black</code></pre>
