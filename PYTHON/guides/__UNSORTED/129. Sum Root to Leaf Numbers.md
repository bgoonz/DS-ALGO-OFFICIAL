## [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/description/)

### Problem:

Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

    Input: [1,2,3]
        1
       / \
      2   3
    Output: 25
    Explanation:
    The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
    The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
    Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

**Example 2:**

    Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
        4
       / \
      9   0
     / \
    5   1
    Output: 1026
    Explanation:
    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
    The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
    Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

### Solution:

To write a clean solution for this promblem, use `0` as indicator of leaf node. If all the children get `0`, it is a leaf node, return the sum of current level.

    /**
     * Definition for a binary tree node.
     * function TreeNode(val) {
     *     this.val = val;
     *     this.left = this.right = null;
     * }
     */
    /**
     * @param {TreeNode} root
     * @return {number}
     */
    var sumNumbers = function(root, sum = 0) {
      if (!root) { return 0 }
      sum = sum * 10 + root.val
      return sumNumbers(root.left, sum) + sumNumbers(root.right, sum) || sum
    };
