"""
	Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

	Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

	Example: 

	You may serialize the following tree:

	    1
	   / \
	  2   3
	     / \
	    4   5

	as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
