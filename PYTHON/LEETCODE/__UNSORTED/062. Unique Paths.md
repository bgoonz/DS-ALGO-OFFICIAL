## [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)

### Problem:

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid (marked ‘Start’ in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

    Input: m = 3, n = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down
    2. Right -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

    Input: m = 7, n = 3
    Output: 28

### Solution:

DP.

Define `f(i, j)` to be the number of total unique paths from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`.

    f(i, 0) = 1
    f(0, j) = 1
    f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) + f(i, j-1)

Only two previous states are dependant. Use dynamic array to reduce memory allocation.

    /**
     * @param {number} m
     * @param {number} n
     * @return {number}
     */
    var uniquePaths = function(m, n) {
      const dp = new Array(m).fill(1)
      while (--n > 0) {
        for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
          dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        }
      }
      return dp[m-1] || 1
    };
