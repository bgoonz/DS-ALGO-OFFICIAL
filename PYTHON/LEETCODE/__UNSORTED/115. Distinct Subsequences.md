## [115. Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/description/)

### Problem:

Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **S** which equals **T**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

**Example 1:**

    Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:

    As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
    (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

    rabbbit
    ^^^^ ^^
    rabbbit
    ^^ ^^^^
    rabbbit
    ^^^ ^^^

**Example 2:**

    Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:

    As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
    (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

    babgbag
    ^^ ^
    babgbag
    ^^    ^
    babgbag
    ^    ^^
    babgbag
      ^  ^^
    babgbag
        ^^^

### Solution:

Define `f(i, j)` to be the number of ways that generate `T[0...j)` from `S[0...i)`.

For `f(i, j)` you can always skip `S[i-1]`, but can only take it when `S[i-1] === T[j-1]`.

    f(0, j) = 0, j > 0 // nothing to delete
    f(i, 0) = 1 // delete all
    f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) + (S[i-1] === T[j-1] ? f(i-1, j-1) : 0)

Dynamic array can be used.

    /**
     * @param {string} s
     * @param {string} t
     * @return {number}
     */
    var numDistinct = function(s, t) {
      const lens = s.length
      const lent = t.length
      const dp = new Array(lent + 1).fill(0)
      dp[0] = 1
      for (let i = 1; i <= lens; i++) {
        for (let j = lent; j >= 1; j--) {
          if (s[i-1] === t[j-1]) {
            dp[j] += dp[j-1]
          }
        }
      }
      return dp[lent]
    };
