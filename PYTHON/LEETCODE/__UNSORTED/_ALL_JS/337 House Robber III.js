// The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

// Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

// Example 1:
//      3
//     / \
//    2   3
//     \   \
//      3   1
// Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
// Example 2:
//      3
//     / \
//    4   5
//   / \   \
//  1   3   1
// Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
