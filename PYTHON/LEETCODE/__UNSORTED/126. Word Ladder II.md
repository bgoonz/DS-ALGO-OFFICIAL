## [126. Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/description/)

### Problem:

Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary’s word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:

1.  Only one letter can be changed at a time
2.  Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.

**Note:**

- Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

    Input:
    beginWord = "hit",
    endWord = "cog",
    wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

    Output:
    [
      ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
      ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
    ]

**Example 2:**

    Input:
    beginWord = "hit"
    endWord = "cog"
    wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

    Output: []

    Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

### Solution:

This is just like [127. Word Ladder](./127.%20Word%20Ladder).

The constrain still works, but instead of deleting the words right away, collect them and delete them all when a level ends, so that we can reuse the words (matching different parents in the same level).

The items in the queue are not just words now. Parent nodes are also kept so that we can backtrack the path from the end.

    /**
     * @param {string} beginWord
     * @param {string} endWord
     * @param {string[]} wordList
     * @return {string[][]}
     */
    function findLadders (beginWord, endWord, wordList) {
      wordList = new Set(wordList)
      if (!wordList.has(endWord)) { return [] }

      const ALPHABET = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

      const result = []
      let isEndWordFound = false
      const levelWords = new Set()
      const queue = [[beginWord, null], null]
      while (queue.length > 1) {
        const node = queue.shift()

        if (node === null) {
          if (isEndWordFound) {
            break
          }
          levelWords.forEach(word => wordList.delete(word))
          levelWords.clear()
          queue.push(null)
          continue
        }

        const word = node[0]

        for (let i = word.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          const head = word.slice(0, i)
          const tail = word.slice(i+1)

          for (let c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
            if (ALPHABET[c] !== word[i]) {
              const w = head + ALPHABET[c] + tail
              if (w === endWord) {
                const path = [endWord]
                for (let n = node; n !== null; n = n[1]) {
                  path.unshift(n[0])
                }
                result.push(path)
                isEndWordFound = true
              }
              if (wordList.has(w)) {
                levelWords.add(w)
                queue.push([w, node])
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }

      return result
    };
