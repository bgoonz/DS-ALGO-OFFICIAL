## [89. Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/description/)

### Problem:

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer _n_ representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**

    Input: 2
    Output: [0,1,3,2]
    Explanation:
    00 - 0
    01 - 1
    11 - 3
    10 - 2

    For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
    For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

    00 - 0
    10 - 2
    11 - 3
    01 - 1

**Example 2:**

    Input: 0
    Output: [0]
    Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
                 A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
                 Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

### Solution:

    0: [  0                                   ]
    1: [  0,   1                              ]
    2: [ 00,  01,  11,  10                    ]
    3: [000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100]

The pattern is self-evident. Reverse the result set and prepend ‘1’ to each item.

Use bitwise shift to speed up the calculation. It is unlikely to overflow since the result set is exponential.

    /**
     * @param {number} n
     * @return {number[]}
     */
    var grayCode = function(n) {
      const result = [0]
      for (let level = 0; level < n; level++) {
        const prefix = 1 << level
        for (let i = result.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          result.push(result[i] + prefix)
        }
      }
      return result
    };
