# RSA & El-GAMAL CRYPTOGRAPHY

## Aim

Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it.
A simple algorithm which will convert a plaintext into cipher text and vice-versa using encryption and decryption respectively.

## Purpose

To create a Encryption/Decryption program using RSA & El-Gamal cyptosystems

## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved using RSA & El-Gamal cyptography
- We use Python to solve this

## Workflow of the Project

_Explaination of RSA_

Algorithm of RSA:-

1. Select two Prime numbers p & q where p ≠ q
2. Calculate n =p\*q
3. Calculate ø(n) = (p-1)\*(q-1)
4. Select e such that , e is relatively prime to ø(n)
   i.e. gcd (e, ø(n)) = 1 and 1<e< ø(n)
5. Calculate d= e^(-1) mod ø(n) or ed mod ø(n)=1
6. Public key = {e , n} , Private key ={d , n}
7. Find out Cipher text using C= P^(e) mod n where P<n,
   C= Cipher text, P=plaintext , e= Encryption Key and n= Block size.
8. P= C^(d) mod n plaintext can be obtained using given formula
   where d= Decryption Key

_Explaination of El-Gamal_

Algorithm of El-Gamal:-

1. Key generation
   a) Select large prime number (P)
   b) Select decryption key /private key (D)
   c) Select second part of encryption key or public key (E1)
   d) Third part of encryption key or public key (E2) E2=E1^(D) mod p
   e) Public key =(E1,E2,p),Private key =D
2. Encryption
   a) Select random integer R
   b) C1= E1^(R) mod p
   c) C2=(PT X E2^(R)) mod p
   d) CT=(C1,C2), CT=ciphertext
3. Decryption
   a) PT =(C2 X (C1^(D))^(-1)) mod p

## Compilation Steps

To run the file, type **python rsa_elgamal.py** in the command prompt
After the script is run, enter:

Choose what you want to do rsa or el-gamal or quit:

1. If you proceed with rsa then follow the steps provided below:-

   - Decide 2 large prime numbers and enter them
   - Enter the public key[e] number (Public key is known to everybody which can be used to encrypt messages)
   - After that, a private key is generated according to the algorithm of step 5
   - Then you need to provide the value of plaintext which will then convert to ciphertext according to step 7
   - And finally the ciphertext would be decrypted to plaintext according to step 8

2. If you proceed with el-gamal then follow the steps provided below:-
   - Decide a large prime number and enter it (P)
   - Enter the decryption key(D)
   - Enter 1st public key (E1)
   - Then E2 is generated according to step 1 d) of el-gamal algorithm
   - Therefore we get the public key i.e (E1,E2,P)
   - For encryption, enter a random number which will then be used to calculate C1 [from step 2 b)]
   - Then provide in the value of plaintext to calculate C2 and hence we will get ciphertext
   - For decryption, we will get plaintext according to step 3 a)
