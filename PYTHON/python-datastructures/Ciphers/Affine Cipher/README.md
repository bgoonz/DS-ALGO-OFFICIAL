# Affine Ciphere

## Aim

To implement Affine Cipher

## Purpose

The Affine Cipher is an algorithm used for Encryption & Decryption

## Short description

- Affine cipher is actually the multiplicative cipher combined with the Caesar cipher.
- The Affine cipher is a mono alphabetic substitution cipher.
- In Affine cipher each and every letter in an alphabet will be mapped to corresponding numeric equivalent for encryption using mathematical functions and it will be converted back into another letter.
- For decryption it uses another mathematical function that converts into integer values to obtain original message.
- The affine cipher needs two keys:
  - Multiplicative cipher multiplication
  - Caesar cipher addition.
- In the affine cipher program, we will split a single integer into two keys.
- **Libraries:**
  - `ascii_lowercase` Module
  - `SystemRandom` Module
  - `random` Module

## Workflow

- The complete process depends on length of the alphabets used.
- The letters of an alphabet of size m are first mapped to the integers in the range 0 … m-1.
- The ‘key’ for the Affine cipher consists of 2 numbers, let's call them a and b. The following discussion assumes the use of a 26 character alphabet (m = 26). a should be chosen to be relatively prime to m (i.e. a should have no factors in common with m).

| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20  | 21  | 22  | 23  | 24  | 25  |

- **Encryption:**
- `E ( x ) = ( a x + b ) mod m`
  - Here,
    - modulus m is size of the alphabet
    - a and b are keys of the cipher.
    - a must be chosen such that a and m are coprime.
- **Decryption:**
- `D ( x ) = a^-1 ( x - b ) mod m`
  - Here,
    - a^-1 is modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. i.e., it satisfies the equation 1 = a a^-1 mod m .

## Compilation Steps

- Download the file [Affine_Ciphere.py](https://github.com/manvitha3579/dummy/blob/main/Affine%20Cipher/Affine_Cipher.py)

- Run the file [Affine_Cipher.py](https://github.com/manvitha3579/dummy/blob/main/Affine%20Cipher/Affine_Cipher.py)

- Input the message you want encrypt or decrypt.

- Input any key ( usually keys will be generated randomly for strong encryption )
- Choose any mode
  - Encrypt
  - Decrypt
- Finally we will obtain encrypted and decrypted test for our input message
