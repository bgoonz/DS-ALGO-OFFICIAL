# Palindrome Check

## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to check if a given string is palindrome or not by recursion

## Purpose

The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution while implementing recursion (if any)

## Short description of project

The project takes in input the string to be checked, and if it comparisons are case sensitive,
and then checks the string by comparing the first and last member of string and checking on a shorter version of string recursively

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

isPalindrome --> recursive method to check if it argument string is a palindrome

After the desired values are entered by the user, the control is passed to the isPalindrome function, which returns True or False, which is then interpreted and an appropriate output is given to the user.

## Required libraries

None

## Compilation Steps

Run the script, after that :

1.  User is prompted to enter a string which will be checked
2.  User is asked if comparisons are to be case sensitive, enter 0 for False, 1 for True
3.  The program tells if the string is a palindrome or not
