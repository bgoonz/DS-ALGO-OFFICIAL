# Bitwise AND

## Aim

Given set S = {1,2,3,....,N}. Find two integers, I and J (where I<J), from set S such that the value of I & J is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, K. In this case, '&' represents the bitwise AND operator.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore bitwise AND.

## Short description of package/script

- The user enters the desired values.
- The max_bit function uses bitwise AND operator and then checks if this is maximum possible value or not.

## Workflow of the Project

- A counter keeps a check on the value of I & J, so that it does not exceed K.
- If maximum bit value becomes equal to K-1, we have found the maximum value of I & J which will be less than K.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. No. of test cases.
2. Space separated value of N and K.

That's it! The max bit value for each test case gets printed.
