# Binary Numbers

## Aim

Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore different operators for conversion into binary form.

## Short description of package/script

- Whenever decimal to binary conversion is done, the number is repeatedly divided by 2 until it could not be divided any further.
- We keep appending the remainder that is obtained each time in a list.
- Maximum streak of 1's is chosen.

## Workflow of the Project

- a while loop saves the remainder obtained in each iteration
- a for loop keeps counter for the maximum consecutive 1's

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. A number in decimal format.

That's it! The binary form would be computed and printed.
