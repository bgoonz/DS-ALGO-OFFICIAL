# Depth First Search

## Aim

To implement depth first search.

## Purpose

The purpose is to understand the functioning of DFS Algorithm in AI.

## Short description of package/script

- First the graph is created, according to the edges entered by the user.
- The details of visited nodes are maintained.
- According to the algorithm, all the nodes are traversed one by one.

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

add_vertex --> Vertex is added to the graph dictionary and it's adjacency list is declared.

add_edge --> Directional edges are added in this function. The edge is directional, i.e., going from source to destination.

add_edge_bidirected --> Bidirectional graph edges are added in this function. The edge is bidirectional, i.e., the edge goes both ways.

dfs_helper --> Function to assist in calling dfs. Also prints the final dfs traversal.

Based on the graph that is obtained according to the user's details, the DFS is done.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. The number of vertices.
2. Name of all the vertices.
3. The number of edges.
4. All the edges as a pair.
5. The start node for traversal.

That's it! The complete traversal will get printed out.
