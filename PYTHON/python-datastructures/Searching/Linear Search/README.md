# Script Name

Linear Search Algorithm.

## Aim

To write a program for Linear search.

## Purpose

To get a understanding about linear search.

## Short description of package/script

- It is a python program for linear search Algorithm.
- It is written in a way that it takes user input.
- It can be used to search an element from an array,list etc.

## Workflow of the Project

- First a function is written to perform linear Search,which
  traverses the whole array and then finds the element.
- Then outside the function user is prompted to input array size,array
  elements and element to be searched.

## Detailed explanation of script, if needed

Linear Search is one of the easiest searching algorithm.
The main aim of a searching algorithm is to search for a
desired element in the whole array. Linear Search sequentially
searches for an element in an array.

## Algorithm

- In Linear Search, we start from the 0th index of the array,
  we compare each element with the key (desired element).

- If the key is same as the element of array ,we return the index
  of that element.

- If the key does not match any element then ,we return -1.

## Examples

```
We need to search 6 in the array.

|1|5|2|0|6|8|
 |______________ is a[0]==6 no then we move to next element.
   |_____________is a[1]==6 no then we move to next element.
     |___________is a[2]==6 no we move to next element.
        |________is a[3]==6 no we move to next element.
           |_____is a[4]==6 yes ,thus we return 4.
```
