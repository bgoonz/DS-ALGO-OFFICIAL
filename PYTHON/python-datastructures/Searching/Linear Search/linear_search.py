# Linear Search in python
# Linear Search is one of the easiest searching algorithm. The main aim of a searching algorithm is to search for a desired element in the whole array. Linear Search sequentially searches for an element in an array.
# algorithm
# In Linear Search, we start from the 0th index of the array, we compare each element with the key (desired element).
# If the key is same as the element of array ,we return the index of that element.
# If the key does not match any element then ,we return -1.
def search(arr, x):  # function to  search.
    for i in range(len(arr)):  # traverses the whole array.
        if arr[i] == x:  # if element is found.
            return i
    return -1  # if element is not found.


# user input
n = int(input("Enter Size of array: "))
arr = []
print("Enter array elements: ")
for _ in range(n):
    e = int(input())
    arr.append(e)
x = int(input("Enter element to be searched: "))
ans = search(arr, x)  # function call
if ans == -1:
    print("Element not found ")
else:
    print("Element found at ", ans)
