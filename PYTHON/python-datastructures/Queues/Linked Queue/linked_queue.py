"""
Queue ADT:
- Queue is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion
performed based on FIFO principle.
- FIFO: First In First Out.

Linked Queue:
- Queue implemented by linked list concept is known as Linked Queue.
- It reduces the complexity in array based queue.
- It manages every enqueue() and dequeue() operation run in O(1) time.

Implementation:
- In our implementation we use head and trail variables that respectively
stores header and trailer of linked queue.
- It is used for easy enqueue() and dequeue() operation.
- There is no upper limit condition, because of linked structure.

Contents:
- Class: LinkedQueue: Manages the queue.
- Methods:
    - clear(): Clears the queue.
    - dequeue(): Deletes first element of the queue and returns it. 
    - enqueue(): Adds the given element at the end of queue.
    - extend(): Extends the queue with given iterable elements.
    - is_empty(): Tells the queue is empty or not.
    - peek(): Return the first element without deleting it.
    - reverse(): Reverses the queue.
