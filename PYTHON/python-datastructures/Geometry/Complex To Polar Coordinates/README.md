# Complex Number to Polar Coordinates

## Aim

Read a complex number as input from user, complex_num and print
its value in polar coordinates.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore cmath library and try and calucate geometric functions using python.

## Short description of package/script

- The user enters a complex number ( x & y values from (x +iy)
- Library used : cmath
- Convert the entered complex number to polar coordinates

## Workflow of the Project

User is asked to enter values for x & y in ( x + iy ).

Once inputted , the r and theta values are calculated and print.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1.  Import cmath library
2.  x & y values of (x + iy)

After this the r is calculated using the abs function , while theta is calculated using phase function present in cmath library.
