# Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Search Tree

"""
Binary trees are trees where any node can have only 0, 1 or 2 children, which are sorted in any order.
Binary Search trees have elements such that for a node, all elements in its left subtree are smaller than it, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than it.
Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root
or the last common node that occurs on the paths from root node to those nodes.

Here, we first check if both numbers exist in tree or not, with exists_in_tree() function by recursively traversing the tree.
If yes then we find the LCA of both the elements with find_lca() function, which follows as :
    if LCA isnt found yet, but current node is one of the elements, then current node is the LCA
    else if both elements are smaller than current node, LCA lies in left subtree
    else if both elements are greater than current node, LCA lies in right subtree
    else if both elements are in different subtrees, then current node is the LCA.
