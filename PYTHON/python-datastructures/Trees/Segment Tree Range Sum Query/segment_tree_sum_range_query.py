"""
Sum range query is the sum of all elements in an array over a given range (l, r) both included, where l and r are the indicies.
eg for arr = [1,2,3,4], sum_range(0,2) = 1+2+3 = 6
The above approach has time complexity : O(n) 
It can be improved by using the segment trees.

Segment trees are special kind of trees that allows answering range queries and updating values in an array effectively (both in O(logn)), 
For an array, its segment tree will have as leaf nodes = the elements of the array,
and its internal nodes store the value of a preprocessed value, like the sum of all its children.

eg arr : [1,2,3,4] can be converted to a segment tree : [0, 10, 3, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
where 0 has been added as first element to ease the calculations

For sum range query, the internal nodes store the sum of their children nodes.
With segment trees, instead of going to every element, we already have the sum calculated in the parent node, so we just need to get that.
to get above example of sum_range(0,2) = 1+2+3 :-
tree : [0, 10, 3, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
index: [0,  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
l = 4, r = 6 are the tree indices
elem 1 and 2 have a common parent, where elem 3 has no common parent with others, so we add tree[r] = 3 to range_sum and shift r left, 
that is, we move r to left if it is even. Similarly, l will have to be moved forward if it is odd.
now l = 4, r = 5, range_sum=3, and we move to parent of both l and r
l = 2, r = 2, now r is even, so tree[r]=tree[2]=3 is added to range_sum. range_sum = 3+3 = 6, r = 1
so we stop, range_sum is our answer
