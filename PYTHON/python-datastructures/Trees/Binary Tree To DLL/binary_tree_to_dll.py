"""
Binary trees are a type of data tree data structure in which a node can only have 0,1 or 2 children only.
Linked list is a type of linear data structure in which one object/node along with data, also contains the address of next object/node.
Doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which a node points to both the element before it, and after it.

A binary tree can be converted to a doubly linked list based on in order traversal, where left and right pointers point to prev and next element Eg :-

     10 
    /  \
   12   15
   /\    /
 25 30  36

can be converted to the doubly linked list

25 <-> 12 <-> 30 <-> 10 <-> 36 <-> 15

We have used an iterative approach here, keeping the track of head and tail of the doubly linked list,
recursively solving left subtree, then redirecting the pointers to connect the last element and the current element,
and finally recursively solving the right subtree
