# Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree

"""
Binary trees are trees where any node can have only 0, 1 or 2 children, which are sorted in any order.
Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root
or the last common node that occurs on the paths from root node to those nodes.

Here, we first check if both numbers exist in tree or not, with exists_in_tree() function by recursively traversing the trees.
If yes then we find the LCA of both the elements with find_lca() function, which follows as :
    if LCA isnt found yet, but current node is one of the elements, then current node is the LCA
    else look for LCA in left and right subtree
        if both elements are found in different subtrees, make current node as LCA
        else if they are in same sub tree, return the LCA of that subtree
