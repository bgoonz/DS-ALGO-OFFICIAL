# BST - Level Order Traversal

## Aim

To perform Level Order Traversal on a Binary Search Tree.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore a type of traversal for BST.

## Short description of package/script

- The user enters the numbers to be used for constructing a BST.
- The BST is constructed according to the rules, with each node having an element entered by the user.
- Level by level the numbers are displayed.

## Workflow of the Project

- The tree is initialized.
- Nodes are inserted.
- Level order traversal is performed.
- The values will be printed according to the level they are in.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. Total number of nodes.
2. All the nodes one by one.

That's it! The numbers will accordingly get printed.
