# Determining DNA Health

## Aim

The aim of this codebase is to find out the solution of the given problem statement,

- Given an array of beneficial gene strings `genes = [g0, g1,...,gn-1]`. Note that these gene sequences are not guaranteed to be distinct.
- An array of gene health values, `health = [h0,h1,...,hn-1]` , where each **_h<sub>i</sub>_** is the health value for gene .
- A set of **_s_** DNA strands where the definition of each strand has three components, **_start_** ,**_end_** , and **_d_**, where **_d_** string is a DNA for which **_g<sub>start</sub>_**,....,**_g<sub>end</sub>_** genes are healthy.

Find and print the respective total healths of the unhealthiest (minimum total health) and healthiest (maximum total health) strands of DNA as two space-separated values on a single line.

## Purpose

Understanding implementations of Strings Data Structure using Interview like problems.

---

## Short Description of the script

- The script will help to understand the string data structure at real life problems.
- The script will also help the students about the approach of a problem which is asked in job interviews.
- The packages used here are, `math`, `bisect` and `collections`. These are the basic packages of Python programming!

---

## Workflow of the codebase

- Firstly, import all the packages, as mentioned earlier.
- Take inputs from the user. User given input is more acceptable because it provides the interaction between the learner and developer.
- Process the user given data through some operations before implementing the final function.
- Implement the `GetHealth` function, which will find out the output for this script.
- Tada! The output is generated!!

## Detailed Explanation of the script

**Input Format**

- The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the total number of genes.
- The second line contains n space-separated strings describing the respective values of `[g0, g1,...,gn-1]`(i.e., the elements of `genes`).
- The third line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of `[h0,h1,...,hn-1]` (i.e., the elements of `health`).
- The fourth line contains an integer, s , denoting the number of strands of DNA to process.
- Each of the s subsequent lines describes a DNA strand in the form `start end d`, denoting that the healthy genes for DNA strand d are **_g<sub>start</sub>_**,....,**_g<sub>end</sub>_** and their respective correlated health values are **_h<sub>start</sub>_**,....,**_h<sub>end</sub>_** .

**Constraints**

**Output Format**

Print two space-separated integers describing the respective total health of the unhealthiest and the healthiest strands of DNA.

### Explanation

Taking a sample input, it will be easier to understand with it!

User Input :

```
Enter the number of the genes :
6
Enter the values of the genes in a space separated manner :
a b c aa d b
Enter the values of the health in a space seprated manner :
1 2 3 4 5 6
Enter the number of strands of DNA to process :
3
Enter DNA strands :
1 5 caaab
0 4 xyz
2 4 bcdybc
```

Let's visualize it -

The ranges of beneficial genes for a specific DNA on the left are highlighed in green and individual instances of beneficial genes on the right are bolded. The total healths of the `s = 3` strands are:

1. Taking the first DNA strand,
   d = caaab
   first = 1
   last = 5

| genes  | `c`aaab | c`aa`ab | ca`aa`b | caaa`b` | caaa`b` |
| :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| values |    3    |    4    |    4    |    2    |    6    |

Hence, the total health of `caaab` is `3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 6 = 19`

2. Taking the second DNA strand,
   d = xyz
   first = 0
   last = 4

| genes  | xyz |
| :----: | :-: |
| values |  0  |

Hence, the total health of `xyz` is `0`

3. Taking the third DNA strand,
   d = bcdybc
   first = 2
   last = 4

| genes  | b`c`dybc | bc`d`ybc | bcdyb`c` |
| :----: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| values |    3     |    5     |    3     |

Hence, the total health of `bcdybc` is `3 + 5 + 3 = 11`

The unhealthiest DNA strand is xyz with a total health of `0`, and the healthiest DNA strand is caaab with a total health of `19` . Thus, we print `0 19` as our answer.
