# Bad String

## Aim

Read a string, S and print its integer value. If S cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore strings and try and except keywords in python.

## Short description of package/script

- The user enters a string.
- Try and except blocks are used to avoid getting an error.

## Workflow of the Project

try --> if it's possible to convert the entered string into an integer then this block will execute.

except --> if it's not possible, then this block will be executed

In try block, 'int' function is used for conversion, if this results in an error the control goes to except block where a print statement gets executed.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. A string.

That's it! If it's possible to convert it into integer, then you'll get the integer else you'll see a 'Bad String' alert.
