# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Aim

The aim is to build a Tic Tac Toe Game using minimax algorithm.

## Purpose

To create a two-player fun game in python.

## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved using minimax algorithm.
- Backtracking is used for keeping track of all states in the game.

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

play_move --> Method for checking the correct move on Tic-Tac-Toe.

copy_game_state --> Method to copy the current game state to new_state of Tic-Tac-Toe.

check_current_state --> Method to check the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe.

print_board --> Method to print the Tic-Tac-Toe Board.

getBestMove --> Method for implement the Minimax Algorithm.

After the desired values are entered by the user, the 'play_move' function gains control and the game begins.

## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. Choose whether you want to go first or after computer.
2. Accordingly take turns and make your choices.
3. When the winning pattern is detected, the winner is declared.

That's it! All the states will be listed too.
