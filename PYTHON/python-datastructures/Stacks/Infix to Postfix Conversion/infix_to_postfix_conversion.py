# Infix expression : When you write an arithmetic expression such as B * C. This type of notation is referred to as infix since the operator is in between the two operands that it is working on.
# Postfix expression : Like BC*, a postfix expression is a collection of operators and operands in which the operator is placed after the operands. That means, in a postfix expression the operator follows the operands.

"""
Algorithm 
1. Scan the infix expression from left to right. 
2. If the scanned character is an ‘(‘, push it to the stack.
3. else If the scanned character is an ‘)’, pop the stack and output it until a ‘(‘ is encountered, discard both '(' and ')'
4. else If the scanned character is an operand, output it. 
5. Else if it is an operand, 
      1 If the precedence of the scanned operator is greater than the precedence of the operator in the stack or the stack is empty or the stack contains a ‘(‘ , push it onto the stack. 
      2 Else, Pop all the operators from the stack which are greater than or equal to in precedence than that of the scanned operator until the stack is not empty or '(' is not encountered. After doing that Push the scanned operator to the stack.  
6. Repeat steps 2-6 until infix expression is scanned. 
7. Empty the stack into the output
8. Print the output
